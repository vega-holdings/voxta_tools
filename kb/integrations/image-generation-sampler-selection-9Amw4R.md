# Image Generation Sampler Selection

> Euler is typically the fastest sampler for image generation and affects the final visual style.

## Answer

When configuring image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion integration), the **Euler** sampler is generally considered faster than DPM. Additionally, the choice of sampler significantly affects the final aesthetic or 'look' of the generated image.

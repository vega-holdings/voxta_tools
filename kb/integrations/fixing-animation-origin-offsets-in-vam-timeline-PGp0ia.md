# Fixing Animation Origin Offsets in VAM Timeline

> Use the Bulk edit feature in VAM Timeline to offset animation nodes when roots differ.

## Answer

To align animations with different origins (e.g., one centered on the foot vs. the body center), you can use the **More -> Bulk** section in the VAM Timeline to move all nodes of an animation. You will need to apply an offset to the nodes to compensate for the difference in root positions.

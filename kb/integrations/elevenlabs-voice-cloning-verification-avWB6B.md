# ElevenLabs Voice Cloning Verification

> Use Instant Cloning on ElevenLabs to bypass strict verification requirements for custom voices.

## Answer

When creating custom voices via ElevenLabs for use in Voxta, you may encounter verification steps. 

*   **Pro Cloning:** Requires strict verification (e.g., proving the voice belongs to you).
*   **Instant Cloning:** Can be used to clone voices quickly without the strict verification process required for Pro Cloning.

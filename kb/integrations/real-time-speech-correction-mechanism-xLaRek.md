# Real-time Speech Correction Mechanism

> Explanation of how streaming STT updates recognized text based on context.

## Answer

Voxta streams recognized words from the STT (Speech-to-Text) model as they are processed. As the recognition progresses, the model updates its previous output based on the context of new words, resulting in visible updates or 'corrections' to the text during the stream.

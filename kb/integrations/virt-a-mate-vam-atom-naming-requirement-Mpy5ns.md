# Virt-a-Mate (VAM) Atom Naming Requirement

> VAM atoms must be explicitly named 'Person', not just be of the Person type.

## Answer

When setting up Voxta with Virt-a-Mate (VAM), ensure that the target Atom's name is explicitly set to `Person` (or the specific name expected by the plugin). It is not sufficient for the Atom to merely be of the *type* 'Person'; the actual Atom ID/Name must match.

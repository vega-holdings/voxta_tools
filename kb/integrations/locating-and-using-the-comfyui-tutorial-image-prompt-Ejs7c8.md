# Locating and Using the ComfyUI Tutorial Image Prompt

> The ComfyUI tutorial prompt is inside the provided zip file and should be imported.

## Answer

The prompt is included inside the zip file associated with the tutorial. It is designed to be imported directly (likely as a workflow file) as shown in the video, rather than copy-pasting the text manually.

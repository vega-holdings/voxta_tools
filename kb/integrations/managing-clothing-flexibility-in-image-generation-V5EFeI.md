# Managing clothing flexibility in Image Generation

> Avoid hardcoding specific clothes in image prompts to allow characters to change outfits dynamically.

## Answer

When configuring Image Generation Prompting Instructions, avoid hardcoding specific clothing items if you want the character to be able to change clothes during the chat.

**Best Practices:**
*   Use generic descriptors (e.g., "discreet colors") in the permanent instructions rather than specific items.
*   Instruct the character on what to wear via chat at the start of the session to maintain flexibility.

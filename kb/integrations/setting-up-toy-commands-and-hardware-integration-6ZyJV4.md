# Setting up toy commands and hardware integration

> Toy commands are handled via Providers found in the portal downloads, while Scenarios handle the logic.

## Answer

To set up toy commands or hardware integrations, you should primarily look into **Providers**, which can be found in the download section of the Voxta portal. Providers are used to add external capabilities and commands to Voxta.

Additionally, **Scenarios** can be used to script logic and trigger functions within the chat context, but the actual interface with hardware typically relies on a configured Provider.

# ElevenLabs Integration Cost vs Quality

> ElevenLabs provides professional voice cloning for Voxta but comes with significant usage costs.

## Answer

For high-quality voice cloning, ElevenLabs is a recommended option within Voxta using the API. However, users should be aware that ElevenLabs is not cheap and usage costs can exceed the cost of the Voxta subscription itself. It is often used when local TTS alternatives do not meet specific quality or cloning requirements.

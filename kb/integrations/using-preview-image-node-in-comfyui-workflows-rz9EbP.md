# Using Preview Image Node in ComfyUI Workflows

> Use the Preview Image node instead of Save Image in ComfyUI to prevent disk clutter.

## Answer

When configuring ComfyUI workflows for Voxta, consider using the **Preview Image** node instead of the **Save Image** node. 

This approach prevents the ComfyUI `output` folder from becoming cluttered with every generated image, while still allowing Voxta to receive and display the image correctly.

# Changing Character Appearance and Profile in Virt-A-Mate Scenes

> Instructions for swapping AI profiles and visual appearances in VaM scenes, with a warning about animation alignment.

## Answer

To change the active AI personality, select the desired character within the **Voxta Plugin** inside Virt-A-Mate.

To change the visual appearance (the model):
1. Save an **Appearance Preset** of your desired look from a source scene.
2. Load that preset onto the character atom in the target Voxta scene.

**Warning:** Animations in Voxta scenes are often motion-captured (mocap) based on specific body dimensions. Using a model with significantly different measurements may result in alignment issues (clipping or "wrong things in wrong places").

# Older Scenarios Compatibility with New VAM Plugin

> Older scenarios are compatible with the new VAM plugin if it is the only version installed.

## Answer

Yes, older scenarios generally work with the new plugin. If the new plugin is the only one present in the `vam/addonpackages` folder, the Virt-A-Mate scene will automatically use that version when loading.

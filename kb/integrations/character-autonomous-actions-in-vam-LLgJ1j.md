# Character Autonomous Actions in VAM

> VAM characters are limited to one action per turn unless autoreplies or Routimator are used.

## Answer

Standard VAM scenes are typically limited to one action per reply cycle, resulting in a back-and-forth interaction style. To enable more autonomous behavior:

1.  **Autoreplies:** Enabling autoreplies allows the character to speak and trigger actions without waiting for user input.
2.  **Routimator:** Newer tools like Routimator allow for more complex action sequences, though older scenes may not support this.

Without these configurations, the character generally waits for user input before acting.

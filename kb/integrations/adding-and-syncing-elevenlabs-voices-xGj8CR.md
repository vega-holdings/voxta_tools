# Using ElevenLabs Voices in Voxta: Built-in and Custom Voices

> Voxta supports both standard ElevenLabs built-in voices and custom voices. Learn how to create or clone a voice in ElevenLabs, add it to your library, and sync it with Voxta.

## Answer

# Using ElevenLabs Voices in Voxta: Built-in and Custom Voices

Voxta integrates with ElevenLabs to provide high-quality text-to-speech voices. The available voices include both standard built-in voices from ElevenLabs and custom voices created by the Voxta team. Additionally, you can add your own custom voices by creating or cloning them in ElevenLabs and syncing them with Voxta.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure the **ElevenLabs** service is active in Voxta. Go to **Services** and verify it's enabled.

## Adding a Custom Voice to Your ElevenLabs Library

1. Log in to your [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account.
2. Add a voice using one of the following methods:
   - **Voice Library**: Browse existing voices, apply filters, and add them to your library.
   - **Voice Design**: Generate a new voice by describing it with text prompts.
   - **Instant Voice Clone**: Clone a voice from a short audio sample (5–10 seconds, clear speech, no background noise). Upload the sample to create the clone.

## (Optional) Renaming the Voice

For easier identification in Voxta, you can rename the voice in ElevenLabs:

- Go to **My Voices**, find the new voice, and edit its name (e.g., add a prefix like `-Alexia`).

## Syncing with Voxta

- The new voice should automatically appear in Voxta's voice list. If it doesn't, refresh Voxta by pressing `Ctrl+R` or restarting the application.

## Selecting the Voice in Voxta

- Open the **Character** menu and go to the **Voice** tab.
- In the voice dropdown, select your newly added voice.

Your character will now use the custom ElevenLabs voice.

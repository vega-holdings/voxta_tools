# Virt-a-Mate Plugin Update Frequency

> Clarification that the VaM plugin does not update as frequently as the server but remains compatible.

## Answer

The Virt-a-Mate (VaM) plugin is not updated with every single Voxta Server release. However, the latest available version of the plugin is generally compatible with the latest Voxta Server version.

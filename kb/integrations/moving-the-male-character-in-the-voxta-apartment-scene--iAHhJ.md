# Moving the Male Character in the Voxta Apartment Scene

> Clarifies that the male character in the Apartment Scene is currently stationary.

## Answer

Currently, the male character in the Voxta Apartment Scene is stationary (e.g., stuck on the couch). While the character can be hidden using Virt-A-Mate tools, he cannot yet be moved around to follow the female character during interactions.

# Voxta Cloud Credits: Renewal, Limits, and Top-Ups

> Voxta Cloud credits reset to the tier limit on the 1st of each month without rollover, though users can purchase top-ups to exceed the standard cap.

## Answer

Voxta Cloud credits operate on a monthly cycle with specific rules regarding resets, rollovers, and limits.

### Monthly Renewal and Rollover
Credits are **reset** to the full amount for your subscribed tier on the first day of each month. Unused credits from the previous month do not roll over; any remaining balance is replaced by the new month's allocation.

### Mid-Month Upgrades
If you upgrade your tier mid-month, you receive a proportionate amount of credits based on the price difference paid. However, the standard monthly reset on the 1st will still normalize your balance to the new tier's limit.

### Top-Ups and Limits
While standard monthly credits are capped by your subscription tier, users can manually **top up** their Voxta Cloud credits. These purchased credits allow you to exceed the maximum credit limit associated with your current tier, enabling accumulation beyond the standard monthly cap.

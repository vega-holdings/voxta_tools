# Recommended Community Resources for Visual Scenarios and ComfyUI

> Recommendations for advanced visual scenarios (AB's Kally) and ComfyUI workflows (Vega's Waifu Maker).

## Answer

For users looking to utilize high-end hardware (e.g., RTX 5090) or explore advanced visual integration in Voxta, the following community resources are recommended:

* **Vega's ComfyUI Waifu Maker**: Useful for generating emotion characters.
* **AB's Kally Scenario**: A strong example of modern scenario design that utilizes AI avatars and background images to create a more visual experience.

*Note: These resources may contain NSFW content.*

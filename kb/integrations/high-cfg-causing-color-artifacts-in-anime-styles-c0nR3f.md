# High CFG causing color artifacts in anime styles

> High CFG values can cause color artifacts in anime-style image generation.

## Answer

When using anime styles for image generation, setting the CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) scale too high can produce weird coloring artifacts on the final image. Try lowering the CFG value to resolve this.

# XTTSv2 Maintenance Status

> XTTSv2 is community-maintained following Coqui's closure.

## Answer

XTTSv2 is no longer actively maintained by its original creators (Coqui) due to the company ceasing operations. Maintenance and updates for the technology, including integrations used in Voxta, are now primarily community-driven efforts.

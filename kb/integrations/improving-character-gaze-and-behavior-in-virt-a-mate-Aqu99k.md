# Improving Character Gaze and Behavior in Virt-A-Mate

> Recommendations for plugins (like Cue) and settings to make VaM characters look at the user during chat.

## Answer

To make a character in Virt-A-Mate (VaM) appear more 'chat friendly' and look at the user while using Voxta:

* **Check Plugin Settings:** Look for settings in active plugins or timeline animations that control where the Person atom is looking.
* **Use 'Life' Plugins:** In blank scenes, adding a 'life' plugin to the character atom helps automate natural behaviors.
* **Recommendation:** The **Cue** plugin is suggested as a decent option for managing these behaviors.

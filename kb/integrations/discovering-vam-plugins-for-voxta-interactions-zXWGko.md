# Discovering VAM Plugins for Voxta Interactions

> Analyze existing VAM Hub scenes to find useful plugins for Voxta integration.

## Answer

To identify useful plugins for VAM companions (such as those enabling reactions to verbal commands), download scenes from the VAM Hub and inspect which plugins are driving the desired behaviors. These can then be incorporated into your default workflow for building scenes.

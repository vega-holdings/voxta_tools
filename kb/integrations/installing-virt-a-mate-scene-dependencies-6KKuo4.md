# Installing and Initializing the Voxta Apartment Scene in Virt-A-Mate

> Instructions for installing the Voxta Apartment Scene dependencies in Virt-A-Mate and initializing the scene using the Setup Voxta button.

## Answer

# Installing and Initializing the Voxta Apartment Scene in Virt-A-Mate

Virt-A-Mate (VaM) is not an "out of the box" application; specific scenes often require additional plugins to function correctly.

## Installation

To install the Voxta Apartment Scene (or other Voxta dependencies), download the necessary `.var` files (typically from the **VAM Hub**). Once downloaded, place the files into the `AddonPackages` folder located in your VaM installation directory (e.g., `vam/AddonPackages`).

## Initialization

When using the Voxta apartment scene, look for a **Setup Voxta** button. It is recommended to press this button *before* pressing **Start**, as it performs necessary background configurations for the scene.

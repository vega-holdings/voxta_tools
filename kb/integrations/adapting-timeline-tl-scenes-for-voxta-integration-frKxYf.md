# Adapting Timeline (TL) Scenes for Voxta Integration

> Modify Timeline animations to loop until triggered by Voxta to adapt third-party scenes.

## Answer

For scenes using Timeline (TL) that were not specifically built for Voxta, you can improve integration by modifying the animation structure.

**Method:**
Change certain animations within the Timeline to **loop** indefinitely until Voxta triggers the next action in the chain. This grants the AI control over the pacing and progression of the scene.

**Compatibility:**
- ALM is reported to integrate well with TL scenes.
- Scenes by creator **Ispinox** are noted to work particularly well with this modification.

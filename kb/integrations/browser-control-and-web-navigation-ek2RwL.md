# Browser Control and Web Navigation

> Clarifies that Voxta cannot natively control web browsers despite AI hallucinations claiming otherwise.

## Answer

No, Voxta does not currently have native capabilities to control web browsers or perform actions like opening YouTube videos. 

If the AI character claims it can do so or provides instructions on how to activate such features, it is a hallucination. While private projects regarding browser automation may exist within the community, it is not a standard public feature.

# Recommended TTS for Emotive and NSFW Audio

> Morpheus is recommended for generating emotive or NSFW audio where standard TTS services may fall flat.

## Answer

While standard TTS services (like ElevenLabs) are improving, they can sometimes struggle with highly emotive or non-verbal sounds (e.g., moaning, gurgling) in VAM scenes. 

For these specific use cases, **Morpheus** is recommended as a superior alternative for generating emotive and NSFW audio. Community members (specifically `@mrdragonfox`) have demonstrated high-quality results with this tool.

# Experimental Voxta Discord Bot Fork for Hardware Integration

> A community fork of the Voxta Discord bot supporting websockets for Raspberry Pi and ESP32 integration.

## Answer

A community fork of the Voxta Discord bot has been created to support websocket connections for hardware integration, specifically targeting devices like Raspberry Pi and ESP32 (e.g., M5Atom). This setup is intended to facilitate smart speaker-like deployments.

**Details:**
- **Repository:** [vega-holdings/voxta-discord-bot](https://github.com/vega-holdings/voxta-discord-bot)
- **Mechanism:** Adds an environment flag and modifies the index to point to a device server.
- **Status:** The author describes the implementation as experimental ("jank") and notes that it may require further work/testing.

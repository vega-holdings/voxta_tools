# Singing and Voice Conversion Support

> Voxta does not currently support direct speech-to-speech voice conversion or singing preservation, though TTS cloning is available via Coqui, F5, and ElevenLabs.

## Answer

Currently, Voxta does not have a native integration for high-quality singing reproduction or direct Speech-to-Speech (STS) conversion (converting audio A to audio B while preserving exact tone/melody). 

*   **Singing:** There is no dedicated support. ElevenLabs voices may attempt to mimic singing styles, but it is not comparable to specialized music generation tools.
*   **Voice Cloning:** You can clone voices for Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation using local services (Coqui, F5, Chatterbox) or ElevenLabs, but this generates new audio from text rather than converting existing audio performance.

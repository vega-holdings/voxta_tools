# Revoking Access to Shared API Keys

> Regenerate API keys in the provider's dashboard to revoke access for shared keys.

## Answer

If you have shared an API key (such as for NovelAI or OpenAI) with another user for testing purposes, you can revoke their access by regenerating the API key or creating a new one in the provider's dashboard. 

For example, with NovelAI, generating a new 'Persistent API Token' and deleting the old one (if applicable/supported by the provider's interface) or simply relying on the regeneration mechanism will invalidate the previous credentials.

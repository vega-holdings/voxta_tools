# Controlling Image Consistency in ComfyUI

> Set the seed control to fixed in ComfyUI to reproduce specific image results.

## Answer

To ensure consistent image generation results (reproducibility) in ComfyUI, set the seed control option to **fixed**. The seed number acts as a unique identifier for the result. Using **random** will generate new variations every time.

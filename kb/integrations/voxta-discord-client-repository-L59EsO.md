# Voxta Discord Client Reference Implementations

> Reference implementations for connecting Voxta to Discord are available in both .NET and Node.js. These repositories serve as examples for building integrations, though they are currently considered Proof of Concept with potential stability issues.

## Answer

Developers can use the following GitHub repositories as reference implementations to understand how to build integrations or clients for Voxta on Discord.

### .NET Implementation
**Repository:** [Voxta.DiscordClient](https://github.com/vega-holdings/Voxta.DiscordClient)

This repository provides a reference implementation for a Voxta Discord Client using .NET.

**Current Status:**
*   Considered a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**.
*   Voice functionality is currently reported as **unstable**.
*   Issues have been observed on both Linux and Windows.

### Node.js Implementation
**Repository:** [voxta-discord-bot](https://github.com/yvon/voxta-discord-bot)

For developers preferring Node.js or JavaScript, this repository serves as an alternative reference implementation.

**Note:** This repository may require updates to function correctly with the latest version of Voxta.

# Availability of Reign's VAM Scenes

> Reign's VAM scenes are currently unavailable but may be re-released with Voxta support.

## Answer

Reign's (`reignmocap`) Virt-A-Mate scenes are currently unavailable and have been removed from the Hub. Community members suggest that new Voxta-compatible versions of these scenes may be released in the future, but the legacy resources are not currently accessible.

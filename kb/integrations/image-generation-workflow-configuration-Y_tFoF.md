# Image Generation Workflow Configuration

> Technical tips for configuring inputs.text and seeds in generation workflows.

## Answer

When configuring workflows (e.g., ComfyUI) for integration with Voxta:

*   **Prompt Input:** The prompt generated by Voxta will replace `inputs.text` in the workflow.
*   **Seed Handling:** You can use a random seed generator node directly within the workflow graph instead of passing a seed path from Voxta.

# Voxta Integration Methods (SignalR / .NET SDK)

> Voxta integrations can be built using the .NET SDK or directly via the SignalR API.

## Answer

Developers looking to integrate with Voxta or build custom clients have two primary options:

1. **.NET SDK**: Useful for kickstarting development.
2. **SignalR API**: Allows starting from scratch. While not extensively documented, it is considered manageable to implement.

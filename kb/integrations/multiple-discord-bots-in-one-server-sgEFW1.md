# Multiple Discord Bots in One Server

> Guidance on running multiple Discord bot instances using separate tokens.

## Answer

Yes, you can have multiple bots in a single server, provided they use different bot tokens. You cannot have more than one instance of the *same* bot (same token) in a server.

**Important Note:** If multiple bots are active in the same channel, they may attempt to respond to the same messages simultaneously, which can lead to confusing interactions.

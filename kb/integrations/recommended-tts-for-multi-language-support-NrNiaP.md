# Recommended TTS for Multi-Language Support

> ElevenLabs provides high-quality multi-language TTS but is expensive.

## Answer

ElevenLabs is recommended for high-quality multi-language speech generation. While it produces excellent results across different languages, users should be aware that it is a more expensive option and can consume cloud credits quickly compared to other services.

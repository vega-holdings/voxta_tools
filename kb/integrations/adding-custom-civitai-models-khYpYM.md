# Adding Custom Civitai Models

> Use Model URN and Lora inputs to add custom Civitai models.

## Answer

To add custom models from Civitai to the image generation module, locate the **Model URN** and **Lora** input fields in the settings. This allows you to utilize specific models found on the Civitai website beyond the defaults.

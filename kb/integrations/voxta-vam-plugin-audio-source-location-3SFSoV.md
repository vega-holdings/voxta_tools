# Voxta VaM Plugin Audio Source Location

> Voxta plugin routes audio to the head of the atom in VaM.

## Answer

In the Virt-A-Mate (VaM) integration, the Voxta plugin routes the generated audio output to the head of the Person atom. This setup ensures the sound originates from the character for spatial audio purposes.

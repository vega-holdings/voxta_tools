# Action List Manager Compatibility with Apartment Scene

> The Voxta Apartment scene is likely incompatible with Action List Manager due to its older architecture.

## Answer

The Voxta Apartment scene is built differently compared to more modern scenes, making it likely incompatible with Action List Manager (ALM). Users have reported success with ALM in demo scenes but failure when attempting to implement it in the legacy Apartment scene.

# 11Labs Module vs Voxta Cloud Credits

> Clarification on credit usage between the local 11Labs module and Voxta Cloud TTS.

## Answer

No, the **11Labs module** (integrated via your own API key) does not use Voxta Cloud credits; it utilizes your personal 11Labs subscription quota.

However, you can access 11Labs voices using **Voxta Cloud credits** by selecting **Voxta Cloud** as your Text-to-Speech service in the settings (cog wheel menu).

# MetaHuman Support in UnrealVoxta

> Current status of MetaHuman integration (lipsync vs animations) in UnrealVoxta.

## Answer

Lipsync functionality currently works for MetaHumans in the UnrealVoxta plugin. However, full integration (specifically hooking up state machines and animations) is currently pending updates in Unreal Engine 5.6.

# Voxy avatar unresponsive or not reacting

> Voxy avatar requires the chat session to be initiated via the Voxy UI while Voxta idles.

## Answer

This issue typically occurs if the chat session is started directly in Voxta rather than through the Voxy interface.

**Correct Procedure:**
1. Start Voxta and let it idle on the Home screen (do **not** start a chat in the Voxta UI).
2. Start Voxy.
3. Choose a chat from the Voxy list and initiate the new chat via the Voxy UI.

**Tip:** You can press `F2` in Voxta to view logs and debug information to see what is happening.

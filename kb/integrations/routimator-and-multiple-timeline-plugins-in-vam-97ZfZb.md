# Routimator and Multiple Timeline Plugins in VaM

> Suggests using Voxta Actions to target specific atoms or switching to Action List Manager as an alternative to Routimator.

## Answer

You can attempt to target specific atoms and plugins using Voxta Actions and Scripts (see the 'Adding Voxta to a VaM Scene' section in the documentation). 

Alternatively, consider using **Action List Manager** (ALM). It is a no-code solution that is often more straightforward for VaM users compared to scripting complex interactions.

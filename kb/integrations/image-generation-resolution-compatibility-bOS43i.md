# Image Generation Resolution Compatibility

> List of working and problematic image resolutions for generation.

## Answer

Users have reported that using presets in the Manage Module is often more reliable than entering custom resolutions by hand. 

**Confirmed Working Resolutions:**
* 13:19 (832x1216)
* 16:9 (1344x768)
* 3:2 (1216x832)
* 2:3 (640x960)

**Reported Issues:**
* 2:3 (832x1248)
* 2:3 (960x1440)

These higher resolutions in the 2:3 aspect ratio were reported to fail during generation.

# Finding Plugins and Triggers in Virt-A-Mate

> Use the `cjyhot.FindPlugins` session plugin to easily locate and manage triggers and plugins in Virt-A-Mate.

## Answer

To locate specific triggers (such as those loading clothing presets) or plugins within Virt-A-Mate, use the session plugin `cjyhot.FindPlugins` available on the Hub. This tool lists all plugins and allows you to open their UIs on demand, making it easier to identify and modify existing triggers.

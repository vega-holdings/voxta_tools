# Florence-2 Model Download Timing

> Florence-2 models download upon first usage/chat, not during the initial service installation.

## Answer

The Florence-2 service installation may appear to finish almost instantly (e.g., in a few seconds) because the actual model weights are not downloaded during the service installation. The model download occurs on-demand when you first start a chat or initialize the session.

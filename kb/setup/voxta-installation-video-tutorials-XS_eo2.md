# Voxta Installation Video Tutorials

> Location of official installation videos and guides.

## Answer

Yes, installation guides and tutorial videos are available in the official documentation under the [Getting Started](https://doc.voxta.ai/docs/getting-started/) section. These resources cover both Voxta Cloud and local installations. Note that while some videos may be slightly older, they are sufficient for understanding the installation process.

# Setup requirements for a Voxta Stream Companion

> Requirements for setting up a Voxta stream companion including avatar type, vision capabilities, and trigger integration.

## Answer

To set up Voxta as an interactive companion for live streaming (e.g., Twitch):

*   **Avatar:** Create a VROID or VRM avatar, or convert a VRChat character.
*   **Software:** Requires Voxta and Voxy (avatar interface).
*   **Services:** Enable **Vision** capabilities so the AI can see the game and comment on situations. Disable Image Generation to save resources.
*   **Interactivity:** Use a Stream Deck or Scenario buttons to trigger specific avatar actions (e.g., animations/dances) based on stream events like subscriptions.

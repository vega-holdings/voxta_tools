# Voxta Local Services vs External Tools (Alltalk)

> Voxta's built-in Chatterbox and Whisper stack is recommended over external tools like Alltalk due to integration complexity.

## Answer

Voxta simplifies local deployment by installing **Chatterbox** (TTS) and **Whisper** (STT) as an all-in-one package. This is often preferred over attempting to integrate external tools like **Alltalk** (which supports Coqui and F5), as users have reported difficulties connecting Voxta to Alltalk remotely or managing the required Linux environments.

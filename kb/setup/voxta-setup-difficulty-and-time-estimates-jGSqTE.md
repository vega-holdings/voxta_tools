# Voxta Setup Difficulty and Time Estimates

> Voxta setup is fast (~30s) with cloud services but more complex with local models.

## Answer

Setup difficulty depends on your chosen configuration:

* **Cloud Services:** A general install using Voxta Cloud for services is very quick (approx. 30 seconds) and easy to get going.
* **Local Services:** Running local models for TTS (Text-to-Speech), STT (Speech-to-Text), and LLMs is more involved and requires a capable GPU.

For installation guides, refer to the [official documentation](https://doc.voxta.ai/docs/what-is-voxta/).

# Default Narrator Character Import Logs on Startup

> Logs regarding missing Narrator characters being imported are normal during first startup.

## Answer

No, this is normal behavior during the first startup. The system detects that the default narrator characters are missing and automatically imports them. You can safely ignore these messages.

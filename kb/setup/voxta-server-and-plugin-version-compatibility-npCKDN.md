# Voxta Server and Plugin Version Compatibility

> Always use the latest versions of Voxta Server and plugins to ensure compatibility and prevent connection errors. Legacy version mappings are not supported, and outdated plugins should be removed.

## Answer

### General Compatibility Guidelines
For optimal compatibility and performance, always use the latest versions of Voxta Server and its plugins.

If you are using an older version of Voxta Server, you must use the specific plugin version that matches that server release. However, the Voxta team does not track or document legacy version mappings. This lack of documentation can lead to compatibility issues and make troubleshooting difficult.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Keep Updated:** Ensure both Voxta Server and all plugins are updated to the latest available versions.
*   **Remove Old Plugins:** You only need the latest plugin version installed. Older plugin versions are unnecessary and can be safely removed to avoid conflicts.

### Troubleshooting Connection Errors
Connection errors are often caused by a version mismatch between the client and the server. Specifically, using an outdated server version with a newer client can trigger connection failures.

To resolve this, verify that you are running the latest version of the Voxta Server.

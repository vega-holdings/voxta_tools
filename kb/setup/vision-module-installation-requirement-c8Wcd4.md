# Vision Module Installation Requirement

> Clarifies that the Vision module must be installed locally even if using Voxta Cloud ComputerVision.

## Answer

No. You must ensure the actual Vision module itself is installed. Enabling the Voxta Cloud ComputerVision module alone is not sufficient without the underlying Vision module installation.

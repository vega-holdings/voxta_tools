# Verifying Patreon-Discord Link Status Using Username Color

> Your username color on the Voxta Discord server indicates whether your Patreon account is correctly linked. A white username means the link failed; a role-specific color means the link succeeded and your subscription role has been assigned.

## Answer

# Verifying Patreon-Discord Link Status Using Username Color

Your Patreon subscription grants you special roles on the Voxta Discord server. To receive these roles, you must link your Patreon account to Discord. The server automatically assigns roles based on your subscription status, and you can verify whether the link is working by looking at your username color in the server.

## What the username colors mean

- **White (default color):** Your Patreon account is not correctly linked to Discord, even if you have an active subscription. This indicates that the server cannot verify your subscription.
- **Role-specific color (non-white):** The link is successful, and your Patreon subscription role has been assigned. The exact color depends on your subscription tier.

## How to link Patreon and Discord

1. Log in to your Patreon account.
2. Go to **Settings** → **Connections**.
3. Find Discord and click **Connect**.
4. Authorize the connection when prompted.
5. Return to the Voxta Discord server; your username color should update within a few minutes.

## Troubleshooting

- If your username remains white after linking, wait a few minutes for the sync to complete.
- Ensure your Discord account is the same one you used to join the Voxta server.
- Double-check that your Patreon subscription is active.
- If the problem persists, the sync may have failed due to a temporary Patreon API issue. Contact a server administrator (e.g., `lapiro`) for assistance.

Note: The server uses an automated integration to assign roles. Manual intervention may be required if the automatic process fails.

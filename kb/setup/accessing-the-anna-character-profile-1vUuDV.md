# Accessing the Anna Character Profile

> Clarifies that the Anna character profile requires a specific Patreon tier subscription and is not included with just the VAM scene files.

## Answer

To access the official "Anna" character profile, you must subscribe to the specific Patreon tier that includes her download (specifically the **Elite Tier** which includes the Voxta Apartment Scene and Anna). 

Note that possessing the Virt-A-Mate (VAM) apartment scene files alone does not grant access to the character profile itself. Alternatively, users can create their own custom character profile on lower tiers.

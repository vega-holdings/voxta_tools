# Coqui Installation Failures

> Ensure Coqui is stopped before installing and wait for the 'install finished' confirmation.

## Answer

Common causes for Coqui installation issues include:
1. **Service Running**: Attempting to run the installer while the Coqui service is already started. Ensure the service is stopped before installing.
2. **Interrupting Installation**: When clicking "Run All Installers", users must wait for the green "install finished" text in the console before leaving the page. The process takes time, and navigating away early interrupts the dependency installation.

# Using Vision Services and the Vision Playground

> Vision services allow the AI to view your screen or webcam for visual context. You can test the service in the Vision Playground before starting a chat to ensure proper configuration.

## Answer

# Vision Services

Vision services enable the AI to see your desktop screen, specific windows, or your webcam feed. This optional feature provides visual context, allowing the AI to react to what you're doing, such as viewing a web browser or a game while chatting.

## Testing with the Vision Playground

After configuring vision services, it is recommended to test the functionality in the **Vision Playground** before starting a chat session. This ensures the service is correctly set up and operational before adding the complexity of a full chat interaction.

The Vision Playground also allows you to test what information the AI retrieves from an image. If vision services are enabled, the AI processes images to extract information; you can upload an image in the playground to see the results.

## Using Vision in Chat

Once vision services are verified, you can start a chat and the AI will be able to process visual input from your screen, selected window, or webcam, depending on your settings. Attached images are also processed using the same vision capabilities.

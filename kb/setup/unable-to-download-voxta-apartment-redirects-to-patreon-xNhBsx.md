# Unable to download Voxta Apartment (Redirects to Patreon)

> Fix for download links redirecting to the Patreon homepage by linking Discord and Patreon accounts.

## Answer

This issue typically occurs if your Patreon account is not properly linked to Discord, preventing verification of your **Ultimate** tier status (which is required for the Apartment scene).

To resolve this:
1. Link your [Patreon and Discord accounts](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access).
2. Ensure your subscription is active.
3. Try accessing the download again (e.g., via the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai) or Discord).

# Voxta Server Download Requirements

> Clarifies that a Patreon subscription is required to download Voxta Server, even for local use.

## Answer

No, you cannot download the Voxta server without a subscription. You must subscribe to at least the lowest [Voxta Patreon tier](https://www.patreon.com/voxta/membership) to gain access to the download channel on Discord.

Once downloaded, you can run the server locally without further costs (provided you have the necessary hardware), but receiving future updates requires an active subscription.

# Locating the Vision Service for Installation

> Clarifies that the Vision service is now named 'Voxta Utilities: Vision'.

## Answer

Older guides may refer to the service simply as 'vision' from when it was experimental. In newer versions of Voxta, look for **Voxta Utilities: Vision** in the services list to install it.

# Downgrading Voxta Version

> Clarification that downgrading Voxta is not officially supported.

## Answer

Downgrading is not an officially supported feature.

When managing versions, the official recommendation is to **upgrade** by extracting the new release into a fresh folder and copying the `Data` folder (which contains settings, characters, and chat data) from the old installation. Overwriting existing files is not recommended.

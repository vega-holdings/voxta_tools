# Voxta Not Working After Installation

> Voxta requires configured services to function, not just the server installation.

## Answer

Simply installing the Voxta Server is not enough. You must also finish the installation and setup of the required **Services** (such as LLM, TTS, and STT) for the application to function. These can be set up using the wizard in the web interface.

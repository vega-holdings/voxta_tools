# How to Fix Missing Patreon Discord Roles and Content Access

> If you're a Patreon subscriber but can't see exclusive Discord channels or assets, ensure your accounts are linked correctly. Follow these steps to link, join the server, sync roles, and troubleshoot missing link options.

## Answer

# Missing Access to Patreon Tier Content on Discord

If you are a Patreon subscriber but cannot see the exclusive Discord channels or download assets (such as the Apartment Scene, VaM scenes, or Voxta content), your Patreon and Discord accounts may not be correctly linked or synced. Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

## Step 1: Link Your Accounts

Ensure your Patreon and Discord accounts are linked. Follow the official guide: [Getting Discord access](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access).

**Tip:** If the Discord linking option is not visible on the Patreon page, try refreshing the page. Then look for a button labeled **Manage Discord Link** (or similar) and click it to proceed.

## Step 2: Join the Discord Server

After linking, you must manually join the creator's Discord server. On Patreon, go to your membership settings and click the **Join Server** button. This step is required to receive the appropriate Discord role.

## Step 3: Refresh the Connection

If you have already linked your accounts but still do not see the correct role (e.g., your username color hasn't changed, or the channels are missing), try disconnecting and reconnecting:

1. Go to **Patreon Settings > More > Connected Apps**.
2. Find Discord and click **Disconnect**.
3. Log in to your Discord account and click **Connect** again to re-link.

## Step 4: Log Out and Back In

Sometimes Discord needs a fresh session to update roles:

- Log out of the Discord app (or web client) and log back in.

## Step 5: Wait for Synchronization

Role assignment can take a few minutes. If you've completed the steps above, wait up to 10 minutes and check again.

## Additional Notes

- Once successfully linked and the role is assigned, your Discord username color will change to match your tier, and the relevant channels will become visible.
- If you still cannot access the content after following these steps, contact the creator's support team for further assistance.

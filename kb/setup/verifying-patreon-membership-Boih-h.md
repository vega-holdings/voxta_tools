# Verifying Patreon Membership and Connecting Voxta Services

> Learn how to link your Patreon and Discord accounts, sync your membership via the Voxta Portal, and obtain an API key to connect Voxta Server.

## Answer

# Verifying Patreon Membership and Connecting Voxta Services

To access Voxta features, you need to verify your Patreon membership by linking your Discord account and syncing via the Voxta Portal. Additionally, you may need to obtain an API key for the Voxta Server.

## Prerequisites

- A Patreon account with an active Voxta subscription.
- A Discord account.

## Step 1: Link Discord to Patreon

Follow the official [Patreon guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access) to link your Discord account. This ensures your Discord roles reflect your tier.

## Step 2: Sync with Voxta Portal

1. Visit the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/).
2. Click the **"Sync With Patreon"** button.
3. If prompted, authorize the connection.

This will update your Voxta Cloud credits and Discord roles.

### Troubleshooting Portal Connection

- If the connection prompt does not appear, ensure your browser allows pop-ups and third-party cookies for the portal.
- Disable any ad-blockers or strict security settings that might block the authentication flow.
- Make sure your Discord account is linked to Patreon as described in Step 1.

## Step 3: Obtain and Enter API Key (for Voxta Server)

1. Log in to the Voxta website and navigate to your account settings to generate an API key.
2. Copy the API key and paste it into the Voxta application settings.
3. The application should connect automatically.

## Additional Notes

- Syncing via the portal is required to refresh your subscription status and credits.
- If you change your Patreon tier, repeat Step 2 to sync the changes.
- For persistent issues, contact support.

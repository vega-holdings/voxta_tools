# Normal Warnings on First Startup

> User profile and Python warnings are normal on the first run until configuration is complete.

## Answer

Yes, certain warnings are expected on a fresh installation:

*   **User Profile Warning:** Appears on the first start before you have saved your user name in the profile settings.
*   **Python Warning:** Appears if the Python virtual environment (venv) has not yet been configured or detected.

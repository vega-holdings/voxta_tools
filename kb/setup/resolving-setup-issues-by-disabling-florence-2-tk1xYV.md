# Resolving Setup Issues by Disabling Florence-2

> Disable Florence-2 (Vision) during setup if experiencing installation issues.

## Answer

If you encounter issues during the initial setup or installation, try proceeding without the Florence-2 (Vision) component. A user reported that performing the install "minus the vision" resolved their stability issues.

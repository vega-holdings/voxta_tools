# Dual PC Setup for Performance

> Offloading LLM and STT to a second PC improves performance for the main VAM machine.

## Answer

To maximize performance, especially when running Virt-A-Mate (VAM), it is recommended to offload AI services (LLM and STT) to a secondary computer. This removes the heavy computational load from the primary machine responsible for rendering graphics and physics.

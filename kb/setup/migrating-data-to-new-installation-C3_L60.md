# Migrating Data to New Installation

> Copy the data folder or manually export/import to migrate content.

## Answer

To migrate your data to a fresh installation:
1.  Try copying the entire `data` folder from the old installation to the new one.
2.  If that does not work, you will need to manually export your content and import it into the new installation.

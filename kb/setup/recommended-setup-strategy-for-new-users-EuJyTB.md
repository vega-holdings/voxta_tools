# Recommended Setup Strategy for New Users

> Start with Voxta Cloud to simplify initial setup and understand system architecture, using included credits. Later, customize individual services to run locally or with other providers.

## Answer

For the simplest initial setup, it is recommended to start with **Voxta Cloud**. This uses the included credits and reduces complexity, helping new users understand the system architecture and component interactions before attempting a fully local installation.

Later, you can customize or swap individual services (such as Text Generation, Summarization, Action Inference, Speech, Voice, or Vision) to run locally or use other external providers. Voxta allows mixing and matching different service providers based on preference, enabling a hybrid setup.

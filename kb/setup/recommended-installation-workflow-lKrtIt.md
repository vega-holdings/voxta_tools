# Recommended Installation Workflow

> Ensure Voxta Server is fully functional before installing addons like Voxy.

## Answer

When setting up the Voxta ecosystem, it is highly recommended to get the **Voxta Server** running and "battle tested" (stable and functional) first. Once the core server is verified to be working, proceed to install and configure addons or clients like Voxy.

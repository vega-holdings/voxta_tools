# Apartment Scenario File Location

> Clarifies that the Apartment scenario is embedded in the character card due to being a legacy asset.

## Answer

The **Apartment** is a legacy asset created before the dedicated **Scenarios** system was implemented in Voxta. As a result, it does not exist as a separate scenario file; its functionality and context are built directly into the character card itself.

# Apartment Scene Character Requirement

> The Apartment Scene requires the Lily character card to be imported.

## Answer

To use the Apartment Scene, you must import the character **Lily** into Voxta. The character data is contained within a `.png` card which needs to be downloaded and imported into the Voxta server.

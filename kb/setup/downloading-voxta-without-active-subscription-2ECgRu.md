# Downloading Voxta without active subscription

> Voxta downloads require an active subscription and are distributed as builds via the portal.

## Answer

No, access to Voxta downloads requires an active subscription. All versions are hosted on the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/).

Additionally, Voxta is distributed as **builds** (archives to be extracted) rather than a traditional installer executable.

# Viewing Missing Update Channels

> Use the Channels & Roles menu to reveal hidden update channels.

## Answer

If you cannot see specific Voxta update channels or announcements in the Discord server, navigate to **Channels & Roles** at the top left of the Discord interface. Ensure you have selected/enabled the relevant channels to make them visible in your channel list.

# Re-running the Setup Wizard

> How to access and re-run the setup Wizard from the Manage Services menu to fix missing services.

## Answer

To ensure all services (including Action Inference) are correctly installed and configured, you can re-run the configuration Wizard. Navigate to **Manage Services**, click **+ Add Services**, and select the **Wizard** button at the top of the page. This is useful for verifying that all necessary components are installed if you suspect a configuration issue.

# Discord Web Login during Setup

> Complete Discord sign-in in the browser without switching to the desktop app during authentication.

## Answer

When performing Discord authentication (e.g., during initial setup or account linking), if a web version of Discord opens, complete the sign-in process there. Do not switch to the Discord desktop app until the web sign-in is fully completed to ensure the authentication token is correctly captured.

# Best Practices for Updating Voxta

> Close Voxta before updating and run 'Run All Installers' immediately after launch.

## Answer

When updating Voxta, follow these critical steps to ensure a smooth transition:

1. **Close Voxta**: Ensure all instances of Voxta (Desktop App and Server) are completely closed before running the installer or extracting new files. This prevents file conflict errors.
2. **Update Dependencies**: Immediately after launching the new version, navigate to **Manage Services** and click **Run All Installers** (often referred to as the "magic button"). It is recommended to do this immediately upon startup to ensure all Python dependencies are correctly updated before using the application.

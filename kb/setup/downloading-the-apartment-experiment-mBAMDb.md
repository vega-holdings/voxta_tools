# Downloading the Apartment Experiment

> The Apartment Experiment is located on the Voxta Discord server in a specific channel requiring Patreon linkage.

## Answer

The Apartment Experiment is available on the Voxta Discord server rather than a direct Patreon post. 

To access it:
1. Ensure your Patreon account is [linked to Discord](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access) to view the restricted channels.
2. Visit the release channel: [Discord Link](https://discord.com/channels/1125594592180445284/1240424952306471033).
3. Look for the post by **Lapiros** (you may need to scroll up slightly if the link lands you below the post).

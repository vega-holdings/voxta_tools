# Verifying Installation Logs

> Check the installer window for red errors before closing it, even if the completion message appears.

## Answer

When running Voxta service installers, it is crucial to review the installer window for any red error messages before closing it. Even if the green "install complete" text appears at the end, specific steps (like dependency downloads) may have failed earlier in the process. These errors often explain why services fail to function post-installation.

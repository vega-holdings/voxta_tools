# Choosing Between the EXE Installer and Portable ZIP

> The EXE installer simplifies updates and allows multiple side-by-side installations, while the portable ZIP version offers manual control and serves as a workaround for the installer's current lack of repair/uninstall features.

## Answer

# Choosing Between the EXE Installer and Portable ZIP

Voxta offers two distribution formats: a standard EXE installer and a portable ZIP archive. Each has its advantages depending on your needs.

## EXE Installer Benefits

- **Simplified Updates**: The installer streamlines the update process, often eliminating the need to manually reinstall or update services with each new version.
- **Custom Installation Path**: You can choose a custom location, enabling multiple side-by-side installations of Voxta.
- **Ease of Use**: Running the installer and following the prompts is straightforward, making it suitable for most users.

## Portable ZIP Benefits

- **Manual Control**: The portable `.zip` version allows for manual installation and updates by extracting files. This can be useful if you prefer to manage files directly.
- **Data Preservation**: When updating, you can preserve your `Data` folder to retain your settings and configurations.
- **Workaround for Installer Limitations**: The EXE installer currently lacks built-in features for repair, uninstall, or automated updates. The portable version serves as a reliable alternative when these features are needed.

## When to Use Each

- **Use the EXE installer** if you want a simple, guided installation, the ability to install multiple copies, and a streamlined update process.
- **Use the portable ZIP** if you need more control over file placement, want to avoid potential installer limitations, or require the ability to easily repair or uninstall by simply deleting the folder.

Both methods are fully supported, and you can switch between them by backing up your `Data` folder and moving it to the new location.

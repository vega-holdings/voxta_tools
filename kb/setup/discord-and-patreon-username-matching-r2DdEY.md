# Discord and Patreon Username Matching

> Clarifies that Discord and Patreon usernames do not need to be identical for the integration to work.

## Answer

No, it is not necessary for your Discord and Patreon usernames to match. You only need to ensure that the Discord account you are using is correctly linked to your Patreon account in the Patreon settings.

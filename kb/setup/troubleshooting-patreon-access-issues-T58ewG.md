# Troubleshooting Patreon Access Issues

> Steps to resolve Patreon subscription access issues including checking payment logs and contacting support.

## Answer

If you are experiencing issues with Patreon access verification:

1. **Basic Checks:** Try logging out and back in, or accessing Patreon from a different device.
2. **Payment History:** Check your Patreon payment log. Previous failed payments (even if currently resolved) can sometimes cause access triggers.
3. **Payment Method:** Some users report success by switching payment providers (e.g., from Card to PayPal).
4. **Reset:** Try unsubscribing and resubscribing.
5. **Support:** If the issue persists, contact the Voxta team member responsible for accounts (e.g., `@lapiro`) via DM.

# Missing Text-Gen Service

> Use the Wizard to set up a missing Text-Gen service if the AI is not replying.

## Answer

If the AI is not replying, it is likely because no Text Generation service is active. You can resolve this by using the **Wizard** (located in the top-left menu) to automatically set up the necessary services, including Text Gen, TTS, and STT.

Alternatively, verify your configuration in the **Services** tab to ensure a Text Gen service is added and toggled on.

# Updating Voxta Desktop App vs Services

> Clarification on the difference between updating the Desktop App via the portal and managing services internally.

## Answer

To update the Voxta Desktop App (Voxy), you must download the latest release from [portal.voxta.ai](https://portal.voxta.ai). 

The "Manage Voxta Services" option does **not** update the main application; it is used to manage and update the internal Python services and dependencies. 

**Note:** The Desktop App is designed not to connect to the server if there is a version mismatch between the client and server components.

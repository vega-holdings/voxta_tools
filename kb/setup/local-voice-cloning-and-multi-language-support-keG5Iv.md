# Local Voice Cloning and Multi-language Support

> Voxta supports local execution and voice cloning/multi-language capabilities depending on the chosen TTS and LLM models.

## Answer

Yes, Voxta can be run locally without connecting to an external server. The ability to mimic voices (voice cloning) and speak in different languages depends on the specific **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** model and **Large Language Model (LLM)** selected.

To achieve this:
1. **TTS:** Choose a TTS service that supports voice cloning (using samples) and the target language (e.g., XTTS, F5-TTS).
2. **LLM:** Ensure the LLM is capable of understanding and generating text in the desired language.

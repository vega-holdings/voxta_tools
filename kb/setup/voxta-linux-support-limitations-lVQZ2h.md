# Voxta Linux Support and Limitations

> Voxta provides early support for Linux, but users should expect feature limitations compared to the Windows version, including the absence of System Vision and window transparency.

## Answer

Voxta's Linux support is currently considered "early support" or partially supported. While the application is available on Linux, it differs from the Windows Desktop application in functionality and installation.

### Feature Limitations
Users should be aware of the following limitations when running Voxta on Linux:

*   **System Vision:** This feature is not available on Linux. Users must rely on browser mappings as an alternative.
*   **Voxy Interface:** Window transparency is not supported on the Linux version.

### Installation
Unlike the Windows version, installing Voxta on Linux requires using the command line. Please refer to the official documentation for specific installation instructions.

# Location for .var files

> .var files are for VAM, not Voxta, and go in the AddonPackages folder.

## Answer

Voxta itself does not use `.var` files directly. These are package files specific to Virt-a-Mate (VAM). They should be placed in the `AddonPackages` folder within your VAM installation directory.

# Upgrading Across Multiple Versions

> Check intermediate release notes when skipping versions during an upgrade.

## Answer

When upgrading Voxta, if you are skipping multiple versions (e.g., jumping from version X to Z, skipping Y), it is critical to review the release notes for the intermediate versions. Major builds may contain specific instructions or breaking changes that are not covered in the standard upgrade procedure.

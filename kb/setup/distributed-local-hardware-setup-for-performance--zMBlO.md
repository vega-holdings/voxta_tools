# Distributed Local Hardware Setup for Performance

> Using a secondary PC connected via high-speed LAN for AI tasks can improve VAM/Voxta performance.

## Answer

For high-end local setups, running AI tasks (LLM, TTS) on a separate rig connected via 10gb/s NICs to the main VAM/Voxta machine can offer better performance than a single system with multiple GPUs. This architecture simulates the network calls to cloud services (like ElevenLabs or OpenAI) while keeping processing local.

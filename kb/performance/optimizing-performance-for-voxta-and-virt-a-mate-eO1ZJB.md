# Optimizing Performance for Voxta and Virt-A-Mate

> Strategies for managing system load including VAM settings, using Voxta Cloud, and hardware considerations.

## Answer

To improve system performance when running Voxta with Virt-A-Mate (VAM):

*   **Tune VAM Settings:** Adjust performance settings directly inside the VAM application. System requirements vary significantly based on scene complexity and whether you are using VR or Desktop mode.
*   **Offload to Cloud:** Use [Voxta Cloud](https://doc.voxta.ai/cloud/voxta-cloud/) services to handle AI processing, removing the computational strain from your local hardware.
*   **Hardware Note:** AMD graphics cards are generally noted by the community as being less optimized for local AI workloads compared to NVIDIA cards.

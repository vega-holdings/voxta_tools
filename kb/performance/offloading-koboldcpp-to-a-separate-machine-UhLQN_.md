# Offloading KoboldCpp to a Separate Machine

> Run KoboldCpp on a secondary machine to save resources for VAM.

## Answer

You can run **KoboldCpp** on a separate computer to offload the computational load from your main machine. This is particularly useful if you are running resource-intensive applications like **Virt-A-Mate (VAM)** on your primary machine alongside Voxta.

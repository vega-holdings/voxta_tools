# Diagnosing Performance Bottlenecks

> Use the Diagnostics screen after chatting to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Answer

To identify which part of the system is causing delays:

1. Chat with the AI for a few lines to generate activity.
2. Open the **Diagnostics** screen (accessible via the interface or `F2`/Advanced menu).
3. Review the performance metrics displayed to pinpoint which service is the bottleneck.

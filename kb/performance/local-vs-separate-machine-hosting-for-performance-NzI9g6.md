# Local vs. Separate Machine Hosting for Performance

> Local hosting improves speed, but separate machines are recommended when running VAM to avoid resource contention.

## Answer

Hosting locally on the same machine should generally result in a speed increase. However, if you are running resource-intensive applications like Virt-a-Mate (VAM), hosting services (especially the LLM) on a separate computer is the best option to manage system resources effectively.

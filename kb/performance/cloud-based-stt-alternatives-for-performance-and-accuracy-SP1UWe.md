# Cloud-based STT alternatives for performance and accuracy

> Deepgram saves local resources; Azure offers high accuracy for unclear speech.

## Answer

Users recommend specific cloud-based Speech-to-Text (STT) services for different needs:

*   **Deepgram:** Recommended for saving local system resources (VRAM/RAM) since it runs in the cloud rather than locally like Whisper.
*   **Azure Speech Services:** Praised for high accuracy, specifically noted for its ability to understand unclear speech or mumbling better than some alternatives.

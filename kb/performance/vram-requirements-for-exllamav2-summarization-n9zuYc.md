# VRAM Requirements for ExLlamaV2 Summarization

> ExLlamaV2 summarization requires significant VRAM, likely exceeding 16GB.

## Answer

Running summarization tasks specifically using **ExLlamaV2** is reported to be highly VRAM intensive. Community members indicate that **16GB VRAM** is likely insufficient for this configuration, suggesting that a card with significantly higher VRAM is required to handle the overhead of summarization alongside generation.

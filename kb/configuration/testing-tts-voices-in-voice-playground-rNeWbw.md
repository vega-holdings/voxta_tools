# Testing TTS Voices in the Voice Playground

> The Voice Playground, accessible from the left sidebar, allows you to test different TTS voices by typing text and hearing the output. Ensure a voice is selected to generate audio.

## Answer

The Voice Playground allows you to test different Text-to-Speech (TTS) voices, accents, and intonations. You can type any text and hear it spoken by the selected voice using the configured TTS service (e.g., Coqui, Azure, or others).

To use the Voice Playground:

1. In the Voxta interface, locate the **Playground** category on the left sidebar.
2. Click on **Text To Speech** (Voice Playground).
3. On the right panel, ensure a valid voice is selected from the **Voices** dropdown (e.g., **Orpheus**). This is required to generate audio.
4. Type or paste your text into the input area and click the play button to hear the synthesized speech.

If no audio is produced, verify that a TTS service is properly configured and that you have selected a voice.

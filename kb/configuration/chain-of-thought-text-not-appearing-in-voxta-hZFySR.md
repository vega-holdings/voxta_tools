# Chain of Thought Text Not Appearing in Voxta

> Fix for Chain of Thought text not appearing in Voxta by adding the 'think_pass_before_reply' augmentation.

## Answer

To ensure Chain of Thought (CoT) functions correctly within Voxta, you must add the specific augmentation `think_pass_before_reply`. This augmentation handles the thought generation pass before the actual reply is processed.

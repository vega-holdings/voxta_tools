# Direct URL for Adding Services

> Direct link to the Add Service page in the Voxta web interface.

## Answer

You can directly access the page to add new services (modules) by navigating to `http://localhost:5384/modules/add` in your web browser. This is useful for quickly reaching the configuration page to enable functionalities like Text Generation, TTS, or STT.

# Recommended Vision Mode for Voxy

> Use Prompted mode instead of Continuous for Voxy vision to optimize model usage.

## Answer

When using vision capabilities with Voxy, it is recommended to use **Prompted** mode rather than **Continuous** mode. 

**Prompted** mode only sends images to the model when a specific action runs, whereas **Continuous** mode constantly processes the webcam feed, which may be unnecessary unless you have a specific use case for constant monitoring.

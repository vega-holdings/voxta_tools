# Voxta Cloud STT Configuration Limitations

> Voxta Cloud lacks STT settings; use Whisper or Deepgram as alternatives.

## Answer

Voxta Cloud currently does not have exposed settings for STT configuration. Developers have indicated this will be added later.

**Workaround:**
Use a different STT service provider such as:
- Whisper (Local)
- Deepgram

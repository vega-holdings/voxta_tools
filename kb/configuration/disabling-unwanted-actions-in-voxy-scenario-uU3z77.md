# Disabling Unwanted Actions in Voxy Scenario

> Disable specific actions in the Voxy scenario to stop unwanted AI behaviors.

## Answer

You can disable specific **Actions** within the Voxy scenario settings in the Voxta interface. This prevents the AI from autonomously selecting and triggering that behavior.

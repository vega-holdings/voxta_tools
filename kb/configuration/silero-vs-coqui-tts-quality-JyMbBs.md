# Silero vs Coqui TTS Quality

> Recommendation to use Coqui over Silero for better TTS quality.

## Answer

When selecting a Text-to-Speech service, **Coqui (XTTS)** is generally considered to provide superior quality compared to **Silero**. Silero may sometimes produce unexpected results (e.g., incorrect gender tone) and is considered inferior for Voxta use cases.

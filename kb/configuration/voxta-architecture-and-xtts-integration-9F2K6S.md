# Voxta Architecture and XTTS Integration

> Voxta acts as a hub integrating external services like XTTSv2 (Coqui) rather than manufacturing the engines itself.

## Answer

Voxta functions as an advanced interface (GUI) that orchestrates various AI components such as Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

For example, **XTTSv2** is a TTS service provided by Coqui that Voxta integrates with to generate speech, rather than a proprietary engine built by Voxta itself.

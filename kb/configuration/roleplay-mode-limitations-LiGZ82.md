# Roleplay Mode Limitations

> Roleplay Mode disables Time Awareness, Augmentations, and Long-term Memory.

## Answer

Selecting **Roleplay Mode** for a character automatically disables **Time Awareness**, **Augmentations** (such as Vision), and **Long-term Memory** features. If your character seems unaware of context provided by these features, check if Roleplay Mode is enabled in the character configuration.

# Voice Cloning Support in Kokoro and Kitten TTS

> Clarification that Kokoro and Kitten TTS do not support voice cloning.

## Answer

No, neither **Kokoro** nor **Kitten TTS** supports voice cloning. They utilize specific pre-defined voice models (e.g., `af_bella`, `am_adam` for Kokoro). 

Users generally report that Kokoro produces higher quality audio compared to Kitten TTS.

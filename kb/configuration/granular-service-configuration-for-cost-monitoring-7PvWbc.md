# Granular Service Configuration for Cost Monitoring

> Configure separate providers (11Labs, OpenRouter, Deepgram) to monitor specific usage costs.

## Answer

To better monitor usage and costs, users can configure separate providers for different functions rather than relying solely on a bundled cloud service. A suggested setup for granular tracking includes:

*   **Voice (TTS):** ElevenLabs
*   **LLM:** OpenRouter
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Deepgram

This approach allows for immediate identification of usage sources. Users can utilize Voxta's configuration switching features (Quick Access Menu) to toggle between these custom setups and Voxta Cloud as needed.

# Verifying Active Services and API Keys

> Check Manage Services for keys and the top-right cogwheel for active session services.

## Answer

To troubleshoot service issues or configure keys:

1. Go to the **Manage Services** page to view installed services and input API keys.
2. Check the **Quick Access Menu** (top right cogwheel) to verify which services are currently selected and active for the session.

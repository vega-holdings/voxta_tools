# KoboldCpp Configuration Best Practices

> Ensure KoboldCpp settings match Voxta and use the web UI for advanced parameter control.

## Answer

When configuring KoboldCpp for use with Voxta, consider the following:

*   **Synchronize Settings:** Ensure that the model settings used in KoboldCpp are reflected in the Voxta settings. Discrepancies between the two configurations can cause integration issues.
*   **Access Advanced Settings:** Enable the option to open the webpage (tick box) when launching KoboldCpp. This allows access to the web UI where you can adjust important runtime settings such as prompts, temperature, and repetition penalty.

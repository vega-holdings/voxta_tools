# Vision Working in Playground but Not with Character

> Enabling vision augmentations in character settings to allow desktop/webcam viewing.

## Answer

To use vision with a specific character, you must enable **Vision augmentations** in that character's configuration settings. 

Yes, this feature allows the character to see your desktop or webcam feed.

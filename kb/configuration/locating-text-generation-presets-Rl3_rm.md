# Location of Text Generation Presets and System Prompts

> Text Generation Presets and System Prompt Addons are located in the settings menu (cog wheel icon) on the right side of the Voxta interface. These options allow configuration of LLM text generation and system behavior.

## Answer

Text generation presets and system prompt addons can be accessed via the settings menu, represented by a cog wheel icon located on the right side of the Voxta interface. These settings allow you to configure how the LLM generates text and define the system behavior.

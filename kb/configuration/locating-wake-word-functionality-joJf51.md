# Wake Word Functionality

> Wake word functionality allows users to activate the chat interface via voice triggers, but it is handled by a separate Voxta Wake Word Addon rather than the standard Speech-to-Text module.

## Answer

Wake word modules in Voxta allow users to initiate a chat session using a voice trigger phrase (e.g., "Hello Voxta"), similar to how standard smart assistants function.

It is important to note that this functionality is not located within the standard Speech-to-Text (STT) module. Instead, it is handled by a separate component known as the **Voxta Wake Word Addon**.

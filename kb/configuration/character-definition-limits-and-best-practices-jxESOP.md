# Character Definition Limits and Best Practices

> Explanation of context window limits regarding character definitions and best practices for concise, effective prompts.

## Answer

Yes, there are limits determined by the LLM's context window (token limit). Providing too much detail can unnecessarily bloat the context and potentially confuse the model, causing it to lose focus on core values. Conversely, too little information may leave the character underdeveloped.

**Best Practices for Character Definitions:**
* **Prioritize Essentials:** Focus on personality, tone, and goals.
* **Be Concise:** Short bullet points are generally more effective than long paragraphs.
* **Reinforce Core Traits:** Use light repetition for key traits instead of large blocks of text.
* **Test and Adjust:** Refine the profile if the AI drifts off-character.

# Reducing Cloud Credit Usage for TTS

> Use local XTTS or NovelAI to reduce TTS credit costs.

## Answer

To save Voxta cloud credits, consider these alternatives to using cloud-based ElevenLabs:

*   **Local XTTS**: If your hardware allows, run XTTS locally for Text-to-Speech. This restricts cloud credit usage to just text generation.
*   **NovelAI**: A less expensive alternative to ElevenLabs (requires a direct subscription to NovelAI).

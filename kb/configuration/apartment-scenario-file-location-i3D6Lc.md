# Apartment Scenario Implementation and Location

> The Apartment scenario is a legacy asset embedded directly into the character card rather than existing as a separate Scenario object, distinguishing it from standard scenarios like Demon Queen.

## Answer

The **Apartment** scenario is a legacy asset created before the dedicated **Scenarios** system was implemented in Voxta. As a result, it operates differently than modern scenarios.

### Key Characteristics

*   **Embedded Logic:** Unlike standard scenarios (e.g., Demon Queen), the Apartment scene does not rely on an associated Scenario object. Its functionality and context are built directly into the character card itself.
*   **No Separate File:** Because it is a legacy asset, it does not exist as a separate scenario file.

This structure means that to use or modify the Apartment scenario, you must interact with the character card data (often associated with VAM/Virt-A-Mate) rather than a standalone scenario configuration.

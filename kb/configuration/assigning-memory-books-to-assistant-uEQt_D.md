# Assigning Memory Books to Assistant

> Locating the Memory Book selector in Assistant settings.

## Answer

In the Assistant configuration settings, look immediately underneath the main character selection dropdown. There is a specific field to select a Memory Book. This assigns the 'private' memory book for that assistant, which is populated and preserved across different chat sessions.

# Voxta API Keys: Configuration, Management, and Troubleshooting

> This comprehensive guide explains the different types of API keys used in Voxta, including how to generate local keys for plugins like VaM, manage third-party service keys, and resolve authentication errors such as HTTP 401 or invalid key states.

## Answer

# Voxta API Keys: Configuration, Management, and Troubleshooting

Voxta utilizes different types of API keys for various functions, ranging from connecting external plugins like Virt-A-Mate (VaM) to integrating with AI providers like OpenAI. Understanding the distinction between these keys is essential for proper configuration, migration, and troubleshooting.

## Types of API Keys

It is important to distinguish between the three main types of keys used within the Voxta ecosystem:

*   **Local Server API Key:** Generated within your Voxta Server application. This key is used to authenticate external software—such as the VaM plugin or Voxy—with your local Voxta Server.
*   **Third-Party Service API Keys:** Generated by external AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, ElevenLabs, NovelAI, OpenRouter). These are required for Voxta to access specific AI services and are managed through your respective provider accounts.
*   **Voxta Cloud API Key:** Provided by Voxta for accessing Voxta Cloud services. This is completely separate from your local server key and third-party keys.

## Local Server API Key (VaM Plugin)

The Local Server API key is used to authenticate the Virt-A-Mate (VaM) plugin with your Voxta Server.

### When is the API key required?

*   **If you have set a password for your Voxta Server account:** You must enter a valid API key in the VaM plugin settings.
*   **If you have not set a password:** You can leave the API key field empty; the plugin will connect without authentication.

### How to generate the API key

1.  Open Voxta Server.
2.  Click on your username (or profile icon) in the bottom left corner of the window.
3.  Select **API Keys** from the menu.
4.  Generate a new personal API key. You can give it a descriptive name (e.g., "VaM Plugin") for easy identification.
5.  Copy this key and paste it into the Voxta plugin settings in Virt-A-Mate.

## Managing Third-Party and Cloud Keys

Third-party keys (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, OpenRouter, etc.) and Voxta Cloud keys are tied to your accounts with the specific providers, not to your specific Voxta installation.

### Reusing Keys on a New Computer

Because these keys are linked to your provider account, you do not need to generate new ones when moving Voxta to a different computer or reinstalling the software. You can simply:

1.  Log in to your third-party provider's website.
2.  Retrieve your existing API key.
3.  Enter it into the Voxta settings on your new system.

### Updating Invalid or Corrupted Keys

If you encounter errors indicating a key is invalid, corrupted, or in an "invalid state" (often due to DPAPI decryption failures), follow these steps to update the key in Voxta Server:

1.  **Obtain a new API key** from your provider:
    *   **Voxta Cloud**: Go to the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/), log in, and click **Generate a new API key**.
    *   **OpenRouter**: Log in to your [OpenRouter dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/), navigate to API Keys, and create a new key.
    *   **Other Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic):** Follow their respective processes to generate a new API key.
2.  **Open Voxta Server** and go to the **Modules** section.
3.  **Edit the configuration** for the provider you are using (e.g., Voxta Cloud, OpenRouter, etc.).
4.  **Paste the new API key** into the appropriate field (usually labeled "API Key" or "Access Token").
5.  **Save** the configuration and restart Voxta Server if necessary.

## Troubleshooting Authentication

If you encounter connection issues or errors, verify the following:

### HTTP 401 Unauthorized / Stuck on "Authenticating"
*   **Cause:** This usually means the wrong key type is used.
*   **Solution:** Ensure you are using the **Local Voxta Server API Key** (generated in the Profile menu) for the VaM plugin, **not** a Voxta Cloud API key or a third-party key.

### "Invalid key for the specified state"
*   **Cause:** The API key stored in Voxta Server has become invalid, corrupted, or cannot be decrypted.
*   **Solution:** Follow the "Updating Invalid or Corrupted Keys" section above to generate a fresh key from your provider and update the Modules configuration.

### General Connection Failures
*   Ensure your Voxta Server is running and accessible on the same network.
*   Double-check that you have entered the key exactly as shown, with no extra spaces.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Keep Confidential:** Treat all API keys like passwords. Never share them publicly.
*   **Revoke if Compromised:** If you suspect a key has been leaked, revoke it immediately through the relevant dashboard (Voxta Server for local keys, or the provider's site for third-party keys) and generate a new one.
*   **Distinct Usage:** Never use a Voxta Cloud key where a Local Server key is required, or vice versa.

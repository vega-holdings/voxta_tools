# Understanding Action Inference

> Explanation of Action Inference as the mechanism for triggering emojis in text chat or animations in visual integrations.

## Answer

Action Inference is a service that enables the AI to determine which actions to execute based on the conversation context.

*   **Function:** It decides whether to use specific actions defined in the current Scenario.
*   **Basic Chat:** In a standard text-only interface, it typically controls emojis or descriptive actions.
*   **Integrations:** When used with visual platforms like VAM (Virt-A-Mate) or Voxy, it drives character animations, expressions, and movements.
*   **Timing:** Actions can be triggered before a character replies, after a character replies, or after the user sends a message.

# Multiple Effects per Event

> Events can execute multiple actions (flags, scripts, storywriter) simultaneously.

## Answer

A single event in Voxta can trigger multiple effects simultaneously. For example, one event can set standard flags, run a script (to handle complex logic), and trigger the Storywriter all in the same execution flow.

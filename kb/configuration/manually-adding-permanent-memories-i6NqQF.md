# Manually Adding Permanent Memories

> Manual entries in memory books act as permanent adjacent memory.

## Answer

You can manually write permanent memories into a character's 'normal' memory book. These entries function as adjacent memory, serving as a reference point that the AI can draw from when relevant keywords are triggered in the conversation.

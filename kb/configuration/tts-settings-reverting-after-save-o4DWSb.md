# TTS Settings Reverting After Save

> Fix for TTS settings not saving by cloning the preset first.

## Answer

This issue typically occurs when trying to modify a default or read-only system preset. To persist your changes:

1. **Clone** the existing preset.
2. Apply your desired settings (Speed, Temperature, etc.) to the **new cloned preset**.
3. Save the new preset.
4. Ensure your character is configured to use this new preset.

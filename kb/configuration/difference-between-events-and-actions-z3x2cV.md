# Difference Between Events and Actions

> Actions are triggered by AI inference, while Events are triggered by deterministic conditions or manual input.

## Answer

Events and Actions in Voxta share a similar technical structure, but they differ primarily in their trigger source:

*   **Actions** are triggered by the AI (LLM) via action inference.
*   **Events** are deterministic and are **not** triggered by the AI. They are activated by conditions (such as time, message counts, or probabilities) or manual commands.

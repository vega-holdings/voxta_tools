# Reducing Character Verbosity

> Limit character verbosity using Max sentences or max_new_tokens settings.

## Answer

To reduce the length of character responses, you can adjust the **Max sentences** option located in the **Text Gen** settings. 

Additionally, lowering the `max_new_tokens` parameter can enforce a strict token limit on the output, ensuring responses remain concise.

# Interrupting Character Speech

> How to configure settings to allow user speech to interrupt character audio.

## Answer

Yes. To allow your voice to interrupt a character:

1. Click your username in the bottom left corner.
2. Select **Profile & Settings**.
3. Ensure the **"Pause Recording During Speech"** setting is **OFF** (not blue).

When this setting is disabled, speaking into the microphone will cut off the character who is currently speaking.

# Limiting Multi-Character Interaction Turns

> Chat flow limits for multi-character scenarios are not configurable via UI and require scripting.

## Answer

Currently, the chat flow (number of back-and-forth interactions between characters) is not customizable via standard UI settings. Modifying this behavior requires complex and experimental scripting.

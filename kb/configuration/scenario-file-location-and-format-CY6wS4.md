# Scenario File Location and Format

> Clarifies that scenario files are JSON format and located in the Data/User/Scenarios folder.

## Answer

Scenario files are stored as `.json` files (not `.js`). They are typically located in the `Data/User/Scenarios` directory for scenarios that have been created or imported.

# Built-in Jailbreaks via NSFW Tab

> Enabling the NSFW tab activates Voxta's built-in jailbreaks, often removing the need for manual configuration.

## Answer

Voxta includes built-in jailbreaks that are activated when the **NSFW tab** is enabled. In normal scenarios, adding a manual jailbreak is not necessary, though specific use cases might still require further tuning.

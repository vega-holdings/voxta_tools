# Vision Input Sources on Mobile Devices

> Clarifies that Windows SDK does not work on mobile, while Webcam and Attachments are supported.

## Answer

The **Windows SDK** (Desktop capture) source is not supported on mobile devices. 

When using Voxta on mobile, you must use one of the following independent sources:
* **Webcam** (Eyes)
* **Attachments** (Image uploads)

# Enabling Experimental Image Generation

> Image generation is an experimental feature in Voxta that requires manual activation in the `appsettings.json` file. It is currently primarily available within playground contexts.

## Answer

Image generation is currently an experimental feature in Voxta. As it is in an early stage of development, it may only be available within specific playground contexts and not yet in the general chat interface.

To enable image generation, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to your Voxta root folder.
2.  Open the `appsettings.json` file using a text editor (such as Notepad or Notepad++).
3.  Locate the settings for experimental features or image generation within the file.
4.  Modify the configuration to enable the feature.

# Usage of {{ user_description }}

> {{ user_description }} is included in ChatInstructUserMessage for character context.

## Answer

The `{{ user_description }}` variable is included in the `ChatInstructUserMessage`. This ensures the character receives the user's description as part of the context when processing user messages.

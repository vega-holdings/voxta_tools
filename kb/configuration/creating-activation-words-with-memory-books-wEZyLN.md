# Creating Activation Words with Memory Books

> Use Memory Book keywords to trigger specific context when an activation word is spoken.

## Answer

You can achieve this using **Memory Books**. Create a memory book entry with the desired context information and add the specific "activation word" as a **keyword** for that entry. When the keyword is mentioned in the chat, Voxta will retrieve that entry and provide it to the AI, effectively activating the context.

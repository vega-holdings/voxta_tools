# Recommended Model for Summarization and Tag Generation

> Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for the summarization service (or preset) to ensure clean tag generation; other models may produce messy output.

## Answer

The summarization service (or preset) is responsible for generating tags, such as action tags, from conversation content. To ensure proper tag generation and avoid messy output, it is recommended to use **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

Users have reported that other models may struggle to process tags cleanly, resulting in inconsistent or malformed tags. Gemini 2.0 Flash has been tested and performs well for this specific task.

In Voxta Cloud, this recommendation applies to the summarization preset configuration.

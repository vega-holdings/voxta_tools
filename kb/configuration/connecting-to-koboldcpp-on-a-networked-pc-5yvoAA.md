# Connecting to KoboldCpp on a Networked PC

> Use the LAN IP address to connect to a remote KoboldCpp instance.

## Answer

If running KoboldCpp on a different computer than the one running Voxta, you must configure the KoboldAI settings in Voxta to use the specific LAN IP address of the second PC instead of the default localhost.

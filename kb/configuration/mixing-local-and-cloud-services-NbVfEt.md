# Mixing Local and Cloud Services

> You can combine local TTS with cloud LLMs in Voxta configuration.

## Answer

Voxta allows you to mix and match different service providers. For example, you can run local Text-to-Speech (TTS) models like Orpheus or Coqui while simultaneously using a cloud-based service for Text Generation (LLM).

# Essential Text Generation Parameters

> Focus on max context tokens, temperature, and min p for text gen configuration.

## Answer

When configuring text generation settings, focus primarily on `max context tokens`, `temperature`, and `min p`. Most other parameters, including presets for summarization and action inference, can typically remain at their default values.

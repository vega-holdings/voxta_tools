# Vision not working due to incorrect provider setting

> Fix vision issues by ensuring the provider is set to florence-2 instead of oobabooga.

## Answer

Check the Vision provider configuration. Ensure it is set to `florence-2`. 

If the vision provider is incorrectly set to `oobabooga`, the Florence model may not download or function correctly. Changing the setting to `florence-2` resolves the issue.

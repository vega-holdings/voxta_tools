# Preserving Permanent Word-for-Word History

> Full word-for-word history requires manual copying to a Memory Book to avoid summarization loss.

## Answer

Yes. If you want to retain a full, word-for-word history of interactions permanently (likely to avoid loss of detail through summarization or context window limits), you must manually copy the text into a Memory Book.

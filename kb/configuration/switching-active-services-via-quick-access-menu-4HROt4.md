# Switching active services via Quick Access Menu

> Use the top-right cog wheel menu to switch between configured services.

## Answer

You can select and switch active services using the **cog wheel menu** (Quick Access Menu) located in the top right corner of the interface. 

**Note:** Services must first be configured in the **Manage Services** (or Manage Modules) page before they appear as options in this menu.

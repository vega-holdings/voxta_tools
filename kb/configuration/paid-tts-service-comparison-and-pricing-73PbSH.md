# Paid TTS Service Comparison and Pricing

> Comparison of paid TTS options like ElevenLabs, Cartesia, and Unreal Speech regarding quality and cost.

## Answer

When selecting a Text-to-Speech (TTS) provider in Voxta, **ElevenLabs** is widely considered the highest quality option, though it is also the most expensive. 

Other paid alternatives available (visible in the Voxta Cloud portal) include **Cartesia** and **Unreal Speech**. 

**Note:** Generally, audio services (TTS) are significantly more expensive to run than text generation (LLM) services.

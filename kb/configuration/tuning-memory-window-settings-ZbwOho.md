# Tuning Memory Window Settings

> Adjust Max Query Results and Memory Window Entries via trial and error.

## Answer

When configuring memory settings (such as **Max Query Results** and **Max Memory Window Entries**), there is no single correct value. It is recommended to increase these values through trial and error to find the 'sweet spot' that works best for your specific setup and context needs.

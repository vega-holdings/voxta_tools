# Controlling Focus in Continuous Vision

> Continuous Vision typically targets the active window; verify focus to control what the AI sees.

## Answer

When using **Continuous Vision**, the system typically captures the currently active window or tab. To ensure the AI comments on a specific application (e.g., a photo viewer), ensure that window is the active focus on your screen. You can verify what the AI is perceiving by asking it "what do you see?" while the desired window is active.

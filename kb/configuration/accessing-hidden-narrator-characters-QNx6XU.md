# Accessing Hidden Narrator Characters

> Direct URLs to access the unlisted Male and Female Narrator characters included in the Voxta base package.

## Answer

The Voxta base package includes Male and Female Narrator characters that are present in the system but may not be listed in the character selection UI. You can access them directly via your browser using their specific UUIDs.

**Direct Access URLs:**
- **Male Narrator:** `http://<your-ip>:<port>/characters/397f9094-fc15-4e36-9017-a3903a0b9575?tab=overview`
- **Female Narrator:** `http://<your-ip>:<port>/characters/d04c5d25-2788-4852-968b-8bb567d571c2?tab=overview`

Replace `<your-ip>:<port>` with your Voxta server address (e.g., `localhost:5384`).

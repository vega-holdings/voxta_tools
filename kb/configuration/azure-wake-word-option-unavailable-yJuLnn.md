# Azure Wake Word option unavailable

> Requires installing the specific Azure On-Device Wake Word module to enable selection.

## Answer

To enable wake word functionality, you must install the **Azure On-Device Wake Word** module. Configuring the standard Azure Speech Service module and adding the `.table` file is not sufficient on its own; the specific wake word module must be installed from the services list (typically found under Speech Transcription or related categories).

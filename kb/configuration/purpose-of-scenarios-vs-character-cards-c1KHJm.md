# Purpose of Scenarios vs Character Cards

> Scenarios provide context and boundaries rather than fixed scripts; the Character Card drives personality.

## Answer

No. While Scenarios allow for defining stages, events, and context, they do not require scripting every response. The **Character Card** primarily drives the personality and interaction style. Scenarios act as an extension to set boundaries, current context, or world knowledge (via memory books), allowing the AI to generate dynamic responses within those constraints rather than following a fixed script.

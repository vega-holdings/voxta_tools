# System Prompt Configuration Hierarchy

> System prompts can be set at the LLM, Scenario, or Character level depending on the desired scope.

## Answer

System prompts can be configured in three locations depending on the desired scope:

1. **Overall LLM Settings:** Applies as a blanket rule for the specific model.
2. **Scenario Settings:** Applies to the specific scenario.
3. **Character Settings:** Applies to individual characters.

This allows users to choose between global rules or specific overrides for characters and scenarios.

# Locating Chat Assets on Local Storage

> File path location for local chat assets.

## Answer

Chat assets can be accessed directly in the local file system if they cannot be enumerated via API. 

**Path:** `\Voxta\Data\Users\[UserUUID]\Chats\Assets`

*Note: The UUID in the path corresponds to the specific user profile.*

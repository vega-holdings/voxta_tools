# Oobabooga 3.1+ Models and Flags Location

> Oobabooga 3.1+ moves models and config to the user_data folder.

## Answer

In Oobabooga version 3.1 and later, the directory structure changed. Models and `CMD_FLAGS` files have been moved to the `user_data` folder. 

**Solution:**
*   Check the `user_data` folder in your Oobabooga installation.
*   Manually copy your models and configuration files to this new location if they were not migrated automatically.

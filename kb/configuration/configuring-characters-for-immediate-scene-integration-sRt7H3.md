# Configuring Characters for Immediate Scene Integration

> Use the default scenario text in the character card to define the starting situation for immediate interaction.

## Answer

To have a character immediately react to a specific context (such as an ongoing scene) without an introduction loop, edit the **Character Card**. Add a description of the starting situation and the desired behavior or mood in the **default scenario text** field. This provides the LLM with the necessary context to generate appropriate responses right away.

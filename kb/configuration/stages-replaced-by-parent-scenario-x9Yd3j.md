# Stages Replaced by Parent Scenario

> The Stages feature has been removed in newer Voxta versions and replaced by Parent Scenario, which provides the same functionality.

## Answer

In newer versions of Voxta, the concept of 'stages' in scenarios has been removed. This functionality is now handled by **Parent Scenario**. The change is essentially a renaming; Parent Scenario serves the same purpose as Stages did previously.

# Missing Summarization Trigger Setting

> The summarization trigger setting is temporarily missing from the UI due to an oversight.

## Answer

The summarization trigger setting is currently missing from the user interface. The developer confirmed it was accidentally omitted during a settings reorganization and is not accessible in the current version.

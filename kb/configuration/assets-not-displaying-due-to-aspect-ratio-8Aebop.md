# Assets Not Displaying Due to Aspect Ratio

> Ensure custom assets use a vertical aspect ratio rather than 16:9 to prevent display issues.

## Answer

If custom assets are not displaying correctly, check their aspect ratio. Assets with a 16:9 (widescreen) ratio might not show up or may appear smaller than intended. Vertical aspect ratios are generally preferred for character assets to ensure they display properly.

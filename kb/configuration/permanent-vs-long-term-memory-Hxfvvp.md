# Permanent vs. Long Term Memory

> Use Memory Books for permanent traits; LTM is automatic and dynamic.

## Answer

Long Term Memory (LTM) is an automatic process that updates and cycles information, typically occurring when summarization cleans the active context. For permanent information that you want to manually control or ensure persists (like specific characteristics), you should use the character's **Memory Book**.

*   **Long Term Memory:** Dynamic, automatic, handles context cleaning.
*   **Memory Book:** Static, permanent references for backstory or traits.

*Note: In recent Voxta releases, trigger words for Memory Book entries are optional, though they can still be added to aid retrieval.*

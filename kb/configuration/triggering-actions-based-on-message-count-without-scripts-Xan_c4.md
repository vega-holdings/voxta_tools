# Triggering Actions Based on Message Count Without Scripts

> Use the Messages Count event condition instead of scripts to trigger actions based on chat length.

## Answer

You can trigger actions based on the number of messages exchanged in a chat using the **Messages Count** condition within the Events system. This functionality is built-in and does not require writing custom scripts.

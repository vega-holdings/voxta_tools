# Configuring Computer Vision Providers

> Explains that ExLamaV2 is not supported for vision tasks and lists supported providers like Florence-2 and Voxta Cloud. Details where to find and enable these settings in the app.

## Answer

To use the Computer Vision service in Voxta, you must select a compatible provider. **ExLamaV2** is a text generation loader and cannot be used for vision tasks.

### Supported Providers
For the Computer Vision service, you should select a vision-specific provider such as:
*   **Florence-2**
*   **Voxta Cloud**

### Configuration
To configure your vision provider, navigate to the **Computer Vision** section in the Voxta app settings. Ensure the service is enabled to activate vision capabilities.

# Enabling Unsolicited Responses (Continuations)

> Unsolicited responses during idle moments are handled by the Voxta Utilities: Continuations feature.

## Answer

To enable unsolicited responses when the conversation is idle, use **Voxta Utilities: Continuations**. This feature allows you to configure timers that trigger a character response after a specific period of silence.

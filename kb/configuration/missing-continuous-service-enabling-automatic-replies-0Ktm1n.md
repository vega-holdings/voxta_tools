# Missing Continuous Service / Enabling Automatic Replies

> Instructions for finding the automatic reply toggle in the Chat Inspector when the Continuous service is missing.

## Answer

In newer versions of Voxta, the functionality for continuous conversation or automatic replies may not be listed as a standalone service. 

To enable it:
1. Open the **Chat Inspector** in the chat interface.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the panel.
3. Look for the toggle to enable automatic replies.

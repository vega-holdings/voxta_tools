# Selecting Active Modules

> Installed modules must be explicitly selected in the settings menu to be active.

## Answer

You can install multiple modules for Voxta, but the active ones must be selected in the configuration menu (top right cog wheel). Only the modules selected in this menu will be used during chat sessions.

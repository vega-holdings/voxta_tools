# Connecting to Unmanaged External Services

> Use the hosting toggle in Advanced Settings to connect to external services.

## Answer

To connect to a service that is not managed directly by Voxta (running externally), check the **Advanced Settings** for a **hosting** toggle. This setting facilitates connections to services using protocols like WebSocket (`ws`) or HTTP that are not launched/managed by the Voxta application itself.

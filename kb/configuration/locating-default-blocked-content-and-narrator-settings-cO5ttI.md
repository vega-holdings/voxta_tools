# Locating Default Blocked Content and Narrator Settings

> The default Narrator settings in the Voxta Base Package control blocked content.

## Answer

To view or edit default constraints (often handled by the Narrator), navigate to **Packages** -> **Voxta Base Package** and edit the **Narrator** entry within that package.

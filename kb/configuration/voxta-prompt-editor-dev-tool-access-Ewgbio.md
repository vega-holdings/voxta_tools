# Voxta Prompt Editor Dev Tool Access

> Instructions for accessing the development version of the Voxta Prompt Editor.

## Answer

A development version of the Prompt Editor is available via the [voxta-prompteditor-dev GitHub repository](https://github.com/vega-holdings/voxta-prompteditor-dev).

**How to Access:**
Due to current integration limitations (referenced as "wwwroot already cooked"), the editor must be accessed manually:
1. Navigate directly to `/manage/prompt-editor` in the browser.
2. Alternatively, clicking the **Help** button may open the page.

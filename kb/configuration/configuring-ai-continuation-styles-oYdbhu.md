# Configuring AI Continuation Styles

> Distinguishes between Idle Continuation (follow-up after silence) and Flag-Based Continuation (monologue/rambling) settings.

## Answer

When configuring AI augmentation settings, there are two primary styles for controlling how the AI continues the conversation:

* **Idle Continuation:** Use this to make the AI 'follow-up' or initiate speech after the user has been silent for a specific duration.
* **Flag-Based Continuation (Monologue):** Use this to enable the AI to ramble, tell stories, or speak at length without user input.

These settings can be found in the module configuration and can be combined if desired.

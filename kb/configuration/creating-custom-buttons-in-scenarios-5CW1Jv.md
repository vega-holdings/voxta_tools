# Creating Custom Buttons in Scenarios

> Custom buttons can be added to scenarios using Events of type Button, though full UI customization is not supported.

## Answer

You can create custom buttons within scenarios by using **Events** with the type set to `Button`. 

**Note:** While you can add specific buttons via events, the general Voxta user interface itself cannot be customized.

# Bulk Entry for Memory Books

> Use macro tools like MiniMouseMacro for bulk data entry into Voxta.

## Answer

If you need to input a large number of entries (e.g., 200+) into Voxta (such as populating a Memory Book), there is currently no native bulk import feature for this specific workflow. Users recommend using automation tools like **MiniMouseMacro** to automate the copy-paste process (`Ctrl+C` -> `Ctrl+V`) to save time compared to manual entry.

# F5-TTS Voice Definition Requirements

> F5-TTS may require a .txt transcript file alongside the reference audio, unlike XTTS.

## Answer

Yes, users have reported that F5-TTS setups may require a `.txt` file (containing the transcript of the reference audio) to be present alongside the voice audio file to function correctly. This contrasts with XTTS, which typically does not require a text transcript for voice definitions.

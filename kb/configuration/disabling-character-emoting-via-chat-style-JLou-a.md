# Disabling Character Emoting via Chat Style

> Change Chat Style in Configuration to disable character emoting.

## Answer

You can change the **Chat Style** in the **Configuration** menu. Selecting a non-roleplay option (such as 'Assistant', often found among the first options) typically prevents the character from generating roleplay actions or emotes.

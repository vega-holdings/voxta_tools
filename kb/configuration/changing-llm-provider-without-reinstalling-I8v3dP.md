# Changing LLM Provider without Reinstalling

> Instructions for switching LLM providers via Manage Services without reinstalling.

## Answer

No, you do not need to reinstall. You can change providers within the app:

1. Go to **Manage Services**.
2. Install the service you want to use (e.g., Exllamav2).
3. Switch the active provider using the slideout menu on the right side of the interface.

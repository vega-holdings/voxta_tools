# Image Generation Workflow Setup

> Image generation setup currently requires manual JSON configuration; UI improvements are planned.

## Answer

Setting up image generation workflows currently requires manual configuration, which may involve editing JSON files to map fields correctly. A future update is planned to add dropdown menus to the UI to simplify this process. Community guides (specifically by user `starmoose`) are recommended for the current manual setup steps.

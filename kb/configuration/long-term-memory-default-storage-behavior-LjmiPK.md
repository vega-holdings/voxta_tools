# Long Term Memory Default Storage Behavior

> Unassigned Long Term Memory writes to the shared World Book; use dedicated books per character.

## Answer

If Long Term Memory is enabled without a specific book assigned, memories may be written to the shared "World Book". To avoid cluttering the shared book or facing potential issues with deleting entries, it is recommended to assign a dedicated Memory Book for each character.

# Silero Module Support Status

> Silero support was removed in beta 146; XTTS is a recommended alternative.

## Answer

Silero was removed from the supported modules list in Voxta starting with version beta 146. Users looking for alternatives are suggested to use XTTS/Coqui, which can also be run as a separate local server.

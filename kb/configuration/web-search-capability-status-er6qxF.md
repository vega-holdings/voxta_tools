# Web Search Capability Status

> Web search via DuckDuckGo is currently broken; rely on LLM training data instead.

## Answer

Currently, the built-in DuckDuckGo augmentation for web search is non-functional. Users are advised to rely on the LLM's internal training data, which often contains sufficient knowledge of pop culture to generate character details. A native web search feature is planned for future builds.

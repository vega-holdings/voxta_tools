# Improving Emotion in Voxta Cloud Voices

> Standard Voxta Cloud voices lack deep emotional expressiveness; ElevenLabs or local alternatives like Fox/Echo are recommended.

## Answer

No, standard Voxta Cloud voices currently have limited emotional range. For highly emotional or expressive speech, the recommended solutions are **ElevenLabs** (Cloud) or **Fox / Echo** (Local). Voice samples generally define the timbre or identity of the voice rather than adding dynamic emotional range to the standard cloud TTS.

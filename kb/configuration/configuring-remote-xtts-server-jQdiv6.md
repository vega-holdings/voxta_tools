# Configuring Remote XTTS Server

> Instructions for connecting Voxta to an XTTS instance running on a different computer using the Remote TTS module.

## Answer

To use an XTTS server hosted on a remote machine:
1. Select the **Remote TTS (HTTP API)** module in Voxta.
2. Edit the URL setting within that module to point to your remote computer's address (e.g., `http://<remote_ip>:<port>`).

# Beta Update Configuration: Appsettings

> Apply configuration changes to the root appsettings file when updating to beta versions.

## Answer

When applying beta updates, the instructions might only mention editing one configuration file. Ensure you also apply the necessary changes to the `appsettings` file located in the root directory of your Voxta installation, not just the file mentioned in the post.

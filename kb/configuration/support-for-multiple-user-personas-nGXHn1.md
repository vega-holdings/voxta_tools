# Support for Multiple User Personas

> Voxta uses a single user persona; prepend names to messages to simulate multiple users.

## Answer

Voxta currently only supports a single user persona. To simulate multiple users (e.g., in a group chat integration), you can prepend the username to the message content (e.g., `[[UserName]]: message`), but the AI will still technically attribute it to the default user persona.

# Bing Search API Character Requirement

> Bing Search requires the Assistant character role to utilize augmentations.

## Answer

The Bing Search API requires the character to be in a mode that supports **augmentations** (function calling). In Voxta, the **Assistant** character is the default role configured with the privileges necessary to execute plugins and access external APIs like Bing Search.

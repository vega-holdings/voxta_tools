# Character Card V3 Support Limitations

> V3 character card support is incomplete, causing issues with alternative greetings.

## Answer

Voxta's support for the V3 character card specification is currently partial. Users have reported that specific fields, most notably **alternative greetings**, often fail to load or function correctly. Full V3 spec support is needed to address these limitations.

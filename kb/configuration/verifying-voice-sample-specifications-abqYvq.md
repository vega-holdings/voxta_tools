# Verifying Voice Sample Specifications

> Check existing WAV files in the samples folder using Audacity to determine correct audio specs.

## Answer

To determine the correct format for voice samples, inspect the existing WAV files in the provided `samples` folder. Using a tool like Audacity allows you to verify the sample rate (often 24kHz or 44.1kHz) and channel configuration (usually Mono) to ensure new samples match the expected format.

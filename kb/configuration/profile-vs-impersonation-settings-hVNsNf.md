# Profile vs. Impersonation Settings

> Explanation of the difference between global Profile settings and per-character Impersonation.

## Answer

In Voxta, your **Profile** consists of a global name and description defining how characters generally perceive you. 

If you wish to use a different name or persona for a specific character, use the **Impersonation** tab/field on that character's card. This overrides the general profile settings for interactions with that specific character only.

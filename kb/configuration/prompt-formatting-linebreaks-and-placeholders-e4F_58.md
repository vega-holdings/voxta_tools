# Prompt Formatting: Linebreaks and Placeholders

> Avoid linebreaks in Voxta prompt instructions and use {{ char }} for character names.

## Answer

When customizing prompts or instructions in Voxta, users have observed that the system may not handle linebreaks well in certain instruction fields. It is recommended to remove linebreaks to ensure stability. Additionally, ensure the correct placeholder `{{ char }}` is used to represent the character's name within the template.

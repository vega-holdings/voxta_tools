# Chatflow Configuration Setting

> Set chatflow to 'chat' instead of 'story' for proper conversational behavior.

## Answer

When configuring the generation settings, ensure the **chatflow** is set to `chat` rather than `story`. This ensures the AI functions as a conversational partner rather than attempting to write a narrative continuation.

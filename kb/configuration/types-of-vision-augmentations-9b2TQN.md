# Types of Vision Augmentations

> Explanation of the difference between Continuous and Prompted vision augmentations.

## Answer

There are two distinct types of vision augmentations available:

1. **Continuous Vision**: Captures the webcam feed continuously and sends images to the vision model for ongoing inference.
2. **Prompted Vision**: Operates as an **Action**. It captures a desktop screenshot or webcam image only when the AI infers from the prompt that the user wants it to "see" or "look at" something.

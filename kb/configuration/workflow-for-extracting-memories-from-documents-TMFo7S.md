# Workflow for Extracting Memories from Documents

> Workflow for importing external text into Memory Books using the extraction feature.

## Answer

The feature allows you to import text documents containing character profiles, stories, or past events. You can generate this content using external LLMs (like ChatGPT or Gemini), save it to a text file, and import it. The Voxta summarization service will then process the document to create memory entries based on the content.

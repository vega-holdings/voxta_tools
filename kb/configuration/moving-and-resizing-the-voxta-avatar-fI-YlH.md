# Moving and Resizing the Voxta Avatar (Voxy)

> Resize the avatar by hovering over it and using the scroll wheel; move it by dragging with the middle mouse button or Ctrl+left click. The avatar stays always on top, allowing you to interact with other windows around it.

## Answer

You can adjust the avatar's size and position using the following mouse controls:

* **Resize:** Hover your cursor over the avatar and use the **scroll wheel** to zoom in or out.
* **Move:** Click and drag with the **middle mouse button** (MMB) or hold **Left Ctrl + Left Mouse Button** to drag.

Note: The avatar stays on top of other windows (always on top). You can interact with other windows around it, but you cannot click directly *through* the character model.

For additional controls, refer to the [Voxy Getting Started guide](https://doc.voxta.ai/voxy/getting-started/).

# Location of Speech Interruption Setting

> The 'Prevent Speech Interruptions' setting is found in Profile & Settings.

## Answer

The setting is located in **Profile & Settings** under **General Options**.

*   **Prevent Speech Interruptions:** When enabled, it stops recording your voice while the AI is speaking.
*   **To allow interruptions:** Disable (uncheck) this option. This allows for more natural conversation but is recommended only when using headphones to avoid audio feedback.

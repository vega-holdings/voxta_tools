# Enabling Vision and Camera Support

> Vision features are now enabled by default and may not show as toggleable options.

## Answer

Vision capabilities are no longer considered experimental in recent versions of Voxta. If you cannot find specific checkboxes to enable vision in the character card configuration, it is because these features are now enabled by default and do not require manual activation.

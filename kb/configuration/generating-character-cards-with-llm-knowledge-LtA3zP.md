# Generating Character Cards with LLM Knowledge

> Use the built-in generation button to create character cards using the LLM's internal knowledge.

## Answer

You can generate character cards directly within the Voxta UI by clicking the generation button on the Character Card tab. Since most LLMs are trained on extensive pop culture data, they can often automatically fill in the logic and fields for known characters (e.g., Mega Man) without needing active web access.

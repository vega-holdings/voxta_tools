# Accessing Message Context Menu in Chat

> Left-click the character icon on a chat line in full-chat mode to open the message menu.

## Answer

To open the menu associated with a specific chat line (often used for editing or message-specific options), **left-click** on the character icon displayed next to that previous chat line. 

**Note:** This functionality requires the interface to be in **full-chat** mode.

# Finding Shared Scenarios

> Location of shared SFW scenarios.

## Answer

Currently, there is a limited number of shared scenarios, primarily focused on teaching scenario creation. A collection of SFW (Safe For Work) scenarios can be found in the dedicated [SFW Scenarios channel](https://discord.com/channels/1125594592180445284/1288599671094120552).

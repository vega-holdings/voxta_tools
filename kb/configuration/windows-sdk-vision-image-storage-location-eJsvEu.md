# Windows SDK Vision Image Storage Location

> Clarifies that Windows SDK vision images are memory-only and suggests using Playground > Vision for testing.

## Answer

Images captured by the Windows SDK are held in memory only and are not stored to disk automatically.

To test the vision service and see what the AI sees, you can use the **Playground > Vision** tool.

# Prompted Vision Window Exclusion

> Prompted Vision ignores windows titled 'voxta' during capture.

## Answer

When using the Prompted Vision feature, windows with the title "voxta" are reportedly ignored by the capture system. This behavior prevents the AI from seeing the Voxta interface itself.

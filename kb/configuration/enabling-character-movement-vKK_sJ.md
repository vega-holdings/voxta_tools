# Enabling Character Movement

> Character movement requires setting up Triggers or using ALM.

Voxta primarily handles speech generation. To enable character movement, you must configure **Triggers** (Voxta's action system) or utilize **ALM** (Advanced Locomotion Mechanics) within the host application.

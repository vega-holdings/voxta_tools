# RPG State Bars in Replies

> Use Scenarios and Notes for RPG state bars to avoid formatting issues.

## Answer

Direct support for appending structured state bars (like RPG stats) to standard chat replies may result in formatting issues. To achieve this effectively, it is recommended to utilize **Scenarios** and **Notes** to handle the additional structured information rather than relying solely on the main chat output.

# Understanding UI Toggle States (Grey vs Green)

> Clarification that toggles positioned to the right are enabled regardless of being grey or green.

## Answer

If the toggle switch is positioned to the right, the feature is enabled. A recent UI update changed the color coding; grey likely indicates the feature is enabled but currently idle (not active at the moment), while the toggle position remains the primary indicator of the 'on' state.

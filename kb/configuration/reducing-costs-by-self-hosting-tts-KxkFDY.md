# Reducing Costs by Self-Hosting TTS

> Self-hosting TTS (e.g., Orpheus) helps reduce high service costs associated with cloud text-to-speech.

## Answer

Text-to-Speech (TTS) services often constitute the highest recurring cost when using cloud services with Voxta. To reduce expenses, users can self-host TTS solutions (such as an Orpheus server) instead of using paid providers.

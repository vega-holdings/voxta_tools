# LLM Assignment for Summarization and Action Inference

> Use the same LLM backend for Text Gen, Summarization, and Action Inference.

## Answer

When configuring services in Voxta, the same LLM backend used for **Text Generation** (Reply) is typically also assigned to **Summarization** and **Action Inference** within the settings menu (cogwheel). This ensures consistent logic across different AI functions.

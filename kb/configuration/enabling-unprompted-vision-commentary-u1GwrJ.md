# Configuring Unprompted Vision Commentary

> Enable continuous vision and auto-continue in the Chat Inspector to allow the Vision service to provide periodic commentary on desktop activity or gameplay.

## Answer

To allow Voxta to comment on your desktop activity (such as browsing, media, or games) without manual prompting, you must configure the Vision service to trigger automatically.

Follow these steps to enable periodic visual commentary:

1. Navigate to **Chat** -> **Inspect** (Chat Inspector).
2. Activate the **continuous vision** setting.
3. Enable the **auto continue** feature.
4. Set the timer to your desired interval (e.g., 10 seconds).

Once configured, the AI will periodically review the vision input and generate responses automatically based on your screen activity.

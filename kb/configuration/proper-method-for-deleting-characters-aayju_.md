# Proper Method for Deleting Characters

> Delete characters via the Voxta App interface rather than deleting files manually.

## Answer

When removing characters from Voxta, do not manually delete the underlying files from the file system. Instead, delete the characters directly through the Voxta App interface to ensure they are removed correctly.

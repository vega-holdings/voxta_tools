# Custom Animation Support and Format

> Custom animations (.vmd) are planned for a future build but not currently supported.

## Answer

Support for custom animations is planned for an upcoming build. When implemented, it is expected to utilize MMD (`.vmd`) animation files. The current public version does not support custom animations yet.

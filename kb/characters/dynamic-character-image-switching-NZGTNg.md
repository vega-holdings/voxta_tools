# Dynamic Character Image Switching

> Character image switching is handled automatically by Voxta based on correct file naming conventions.

## Answer

Voxta automatically handles switching between character images based on file naming conventions. As long as your image files are named correctly (typically matching emotions or states), the system will switch them automatically without requiring complex manual scripting.

# Using Animated PNGs (APNG) for Character Images

> APNGs can be used for character visuals if renamed to .png, relying on browser support for playback.

## Answer

You can use APNG (Animated PNG) files for character images in Voxta.

**Requirements:**
- The file extension must be manually renamed to `.png` (not `.apng`).

**Limitations:**
- There is no animation control (e.g., start/stop triggers) within the software; it relies on the browser's native support to play the animation loop.

*Note: Full video support is planned for future updates.*

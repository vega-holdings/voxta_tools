# Testing Dynamic Avatars in Normal Chat

> Use the default character Catherine to test dynamic avatar changes in normal chat.

## Answer

Normal chat sessions in Voxta support changing avatars (dynamic images/expressions). To test this functionality, users should chat with **Catherine**, the default character included in Voxta, as she is configured to demonstrate this feature.

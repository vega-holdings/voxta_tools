# Learning Scripting from Built-in Characters

> Use the built-in Catherine character as a reference for scripting choices.

## Answer

To learn how to script choices in Voxta, examine the built-in **Catherine** character card. It demonstrates how choices are implemented. 

**Recommendation:** Clone the character card to experiment with the scripts without modifying the original.

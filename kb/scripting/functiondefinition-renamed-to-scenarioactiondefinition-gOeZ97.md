# FunctionDefinition renamed to ScenarioActionDefinition

> The FunctionDefinition type has been renamed to ScenarioActionDefinition in the scripting API.

## Answer

`FunctionDefinition` has been renamed to `ScenarioActionDefinition`. The underlying functionality for defining actions remains the same, but the type name has changed and must be updated in your code. This applies to action injections in both scenarios and single character chats.

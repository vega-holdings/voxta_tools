# VoxtaPluginBase C# API for Virt-A-Mate

> A C# API wrapper (VoxtaPluginBase) for the official Voxta VaM plugin that handles callbacks and avoids JSONStorables.

## Answer

`VoxtaPluginBase` is a community-developed plugin designed to provide a C# API for integrating with the official Voxta Virt-A-Mate (VaM) plugin. It allows developers to interface with Voxta without relying on VaM `JSONStorables`.

**Key Features:**
*   Register callbacks for actions, events, and state changes.
*   Supports listeners at the specific character level or for all characters globally.
*   Free to use.

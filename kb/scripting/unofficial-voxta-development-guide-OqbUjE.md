# Unofficial Voxta Development Guide and Package Specifications

> Community-maintained resources for Voxta development, including a protocol guide and package specifications for building integrations and character card generators.

## Answer

Unofficial development resources for Voxta are available on GitHub to assist developers in building integrations and tools.

### Available Resources

*   **[Voxta Development Guide](https://github.com/vega-holdings/voxta_tools/blob/main/VOXTA_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Documents the Voxta protocol. This guide is particularly useful for providing context to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating code for Voxta integrations.
*   **[Voxta Package Specification](https://github.com/vega-holdings/voxta_tools/blob/main/Voxta_Package.md)**: Provides an updated unofficial specification for Voxta packages. This documentation is essential for building character card generators and native support tools.

These resources are hosted in the [voxta_tools](https://github.com/vega-holdings/voxta_tools) repository and are community-maintained.

# Using Gemini Gems to Assist with Voxta Configuration

> Best practices for setting up a Google Gemini 'Gem' to assist with Voxta projects.

## Answer

When using Google Gemini's 'Gem' feature to create an assistant for Voxta development:

*   **Avoid** asking it to output entire JSON configuration files directly, as this often fails.
*   **Do** build a specific knowledge base for the Gem containing:
    *   Full Voxta documentation.
    *   Interaction style guidelines.
    *   Project scope.
    *   Formatting requirements.

# Audio AppTriggers in Voxy Scenario

> Clarification regarding a bug preventing audio appTriggers from working in the Voxy scenario.

## Answer

At the time of this discussion, there was a known bug in the `appTrigger` parsing logic for audio within the Voxy scenario preventing it from working correctly. The developer confirmed a fix would be released in a future build to handle audio better.

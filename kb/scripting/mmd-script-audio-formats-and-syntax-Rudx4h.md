# MMD Script Audio Formats and Syntax

> Supported audio formats and quote syntax for scripts.

## Answer

When creating scripts (such as for MMD dances), the system supports both `.wav` and `.mp3` file formats for audio. Additionally, the script syntax accepts both single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotation marks.

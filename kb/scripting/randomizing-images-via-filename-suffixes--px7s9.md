# Randomizing Images via Filename Suffixes

> Append _2, _3 to filenames to enable automatic image randomization in default scripts.

## Answer

When using the default script, you can randomize images (such as character expressions) by appending suffixes like `_2`, `_3`, etc. to the filenames. The system will automatically randomize selection among images sharing the base name with these numbered suffixes.

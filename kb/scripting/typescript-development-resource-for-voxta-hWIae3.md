# TypeScript Development Resource for Voxta

> Recommendation to use voxta-discord-bot as a TypeScript reference and notes on the C# SDK.

## Answer

For developers looking to build custom integrations using TypeScript, the `voxta-discord-bot` by `@yvonc` is recommended as a good reference implementation. This is particularly useful if you do not wish to use the standard provider. 

Additionally, note that the official Voxta SDK is primarily C# based, which may require using C# or helper applications for integration.

# Downloading Gated Models

> Visit the model URL to apply for access or accept terms, then retry the installation.

## Answer

Some models require you to visit their hosting URL (often on Hugging Face) to apply for access or accept terms and conditions before they can be downloaded. You will need to create an account on the site, apply/accept the terms, and then run the installer again.

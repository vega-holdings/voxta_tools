# Character Switching to English in Local LLMs

> Local LLMs often revert to English; use Claude or OpenAI for reliable non-English performance.

## Answer

Local LLMs often struggle to strictly adhere to non-English languages and may fall back to English during conversation. Community members report that finding local models with perfect consistency (e.g., for German) is difficult. 

**Workaround:**
For reliable performance in specific target languages without English fallback, it is recommended to use cloud-based models like **Claude** or **OpenAI** instead of local LLMs.

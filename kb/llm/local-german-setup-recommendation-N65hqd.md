# Local German Setup Recommendation

> Recommendation for using Gemma 3 and F5-TTS for a local German Voxta setup.

## Answer

For a fully local / self-hosted German language setup, users have reported success combining:
*   **LLM:** Gemma 3
*   **TTS:** F5-TTS (Note: Older German finetunes may require Voxta 0.141)

Users noted this setup is "almost perfect," though F5-TTS may occasionally have a slight American accent.

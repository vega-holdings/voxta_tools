# Anthropic Pro Plan vs API Access

> Clarifies that Anthropic Pro plans do not include API keys required for Voxta.

## Answer

No, the Anthropic Pro plan (used for Claude.ai) does not include API access. API access requires a separate account where credits are purchased specifically for API usage. To use Anthropic models in Voxta, you must either purchase API credits directly from Anthropic or use a service like **OpenRouter**.

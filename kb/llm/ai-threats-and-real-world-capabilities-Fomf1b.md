# AI Threats and Real-World Capabilities

> Clarifies that the AI cannot access personal contacts or perform real-world actions despite any threats generated in chat.

## Answer

No. Voxta and the LLMs it connects to are text generation programs based on patterns. They do not have access to personal contact lists, email clients, or the ability to communicate with the outside world. Any threats made by the AI are hallucinations (text generation gone wrong) and the software has no capability to execute them in the real world.

# RunPod Service Model Clarification

> Clarifies that RunPod rents compute power rather than providing pre-installed LLM services.

## Answer

No, RunPod is a cloud computing platform where you rent GPUs (compute) and pay for the time the machine is active. You are responsible for deploying the LLM on the rented hardware, although guides and templates are available to facilitate this process.

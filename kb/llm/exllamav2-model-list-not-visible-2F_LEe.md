# ExLlamaV2 Model List Not Visible

> Fix for missing model selection dropdown in ExLlamaV2 by editing the preset.

## Answer

If the model list does not appear immediately during the ExLlamaV2 setup:

1. Proceed with the initial setup.
2. Locate the service preset in the interface.
3. Click the **Edit** button on the preset.
4. In the configuration screen that opens, the dropdown list to choose and download a model should be visible.

# VRAM Requirements for Silicon Maid LLM

> GTX 1060 (6GB) is insufficient for Silicon Maid LLM.

## Answer

The **Silicon Maid** LLM typically requires more VRAM than the 6GB available on cards like the **GTX 1060**. Attempting to run it on 6GB hardware may result in performance issues or inability to load the model.

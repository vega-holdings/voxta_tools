# Voxta Benchmark Tool Evaluation Scope

> The Benchmark tool tests logic and actions but not chat output style.

## Answer

The Voxta Benchmark tool is designed to assess an LLM's logic, instruction following, and action inference capabilities. However, it does not evaluate **chat output style** or prose quality. Users should test models manually to determine if the writing style matches their preferences, using the benchmark score primarily for functional reliability.

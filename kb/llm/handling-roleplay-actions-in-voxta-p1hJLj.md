# Handling Roleplay Actions in Voxta

> Roleplay action handling depends on the chosen LLM model and the prompt template.

## Answer

Roleplay performance depends on two key factors:

1. **The LLM Model**: Different models have varying capabilities in distinguishing between character dialogue, thoughts, and narration. Official documentation recommends models like **Loyal-Macaroni-Maid-7B** or **Silicon-Maid-7B** for roleplay scenarios.
2. **Prompt Template**: The template used structures the context for the AI. Using a template designed for roleplay ensures the model understands the syntax for actions.

# Character Compliance and Personality

> AI characters have personalities and may not strictly follow spoken instructions.

## Answer

When speaking instructions to a character, they may not always follow them strictly. As AI personas with defined personalities and quirks, they might refuse or interpret instructions differently, rather than acting as a robotic command interface.

# Stopping Descriptive Text Generation

> Prevent descriptive text by adjusting prompts or changing the LLM.

## Answer

Descriptive text generation is determined by the LLM. To stop it:

1. **Prompting:** Update your prompt to explicitly forbid narration or descriptive text.
2. **Model Selection:** Switch to a different LLM that adheres more strictly to dialogue-only instructions.

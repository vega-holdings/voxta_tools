# Non-English Language Support Requirements

> Requirements for using LLM and TTS models with non-English languages.

## Answer

To successfully use Voxta in other languages (e.g., Portuguese), ensure the following components are compatible:

1. **LLM Selection**: The model must be capable of generating the target language fluently. Some models may understand the language but struggle to reply in it.
2. **TTS Model**: The Text-to-Speech service must be trained or support the specific language.
3. **Voice Selection**: The specific voice profile used must be compatible with the language.

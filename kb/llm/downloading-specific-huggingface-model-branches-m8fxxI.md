# Downloading Specific HuggingFace Model Branches

> Syntax for downloading specific branches or revisions of HuggingFace models.

## Answer

Yes, you can specify a branch or revision using the following syntax string:

`hf:author/repo@branch:path/filename1,path/filename2`

This allows you to target specific branches (like `4.0`) and optionally filter for specific files.

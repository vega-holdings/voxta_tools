# Loading Gemma 3 Models

> Use updated external providers like KoboldCpp or LM Studio to load newer models like Gemma 3.

## Answer

Newer models like Gemma 3 often require updated loaders that may not yet be present in Voxta's inbuilt service.

**Solution:**
Use an external LLM provider that supports the model, such as the latest version of **KoboldCpp** or **LM Studio**, and connect it to Voxta.

# DeepSeek-R1 Chain of Thought Support in OpenAI Compatible Service

> The OpenAI Compatible service in Voxta lacks UI support for Chain of Thought/thinking tags found in models like DeepSeek-R1.

## Answer

The OpenAI Compatible API service in Voxta does not currently support the "thinking box" feature or specific parsing for Chain of Thought (CoT) output. As a result, reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 may not display the thinking process correctly in the UI (it may appear as raw text or not be hidden) when connected via this service.

# Monitoring Model Downloads via Diagnostics

> Press F2 to view model download progress in the Diagnostics window.

## Answer

Voxta can automatically download models (such as EXL2 variants) when a chat or benchmark is initiated with a new model selected. You can monitor the download progress and status by pressing `F2` to open the Diagnostics/Console window.

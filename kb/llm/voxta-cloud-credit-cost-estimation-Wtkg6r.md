# Voxta Cloud Credits: Pricing, Estimation, and Monitoring

> Voxta Cloud credit costs generally mirror the pricing of underlying providers like OpenRouter and ElevenLabs. You can view specific model pricing and monitor detailed usage via the Voxta Portal.

## Answer

Voxta Cloud credit costs are designed to align closely with the pricing of the underlying service providers. While not exact, the value of credits stays as close as possible to the official rates of these third-party services.

### Estimating Costs
To estimate your credit usage, refer to the official pricing tables of the following providers integrated with Voxta:

*   **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)** (for LLMs)
*   **[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)** (for TTS)
*   Cartesia
*   Deepgram

### Checking Specific Model Pricing
For specific pricing details on Voxta Cloud models (such as Mistral Nemo), navigate to the **Models Pricing** section on the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/). This section displays the cost per 1k tokens for available models.

### Monitoring Usage and Cost Factors
You can track detailed credit consumption directly on the Voxta Portal. Keep in mind that credit consumption varies significantly based on the task:

*   **High Usage:** Large Language Models (LLMs) and high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) services (e.g., ElevenLabs) consume credits the fastest.
*   **Low Usage:** Utility tasks, such as action inference and summarization, typically use very few credits.

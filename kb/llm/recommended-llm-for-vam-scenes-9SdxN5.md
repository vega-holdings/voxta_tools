# Recommended LLM for VAM Scenes

> Silicon Maid is recommended for VAM scenes due to legacy compatibility and speed.

## Answer

Silicon Maid (Silicon-Maid-7B) is a fast model recommended for beginners. It is noted to work particularly well with VAM (Virt-A-Mate) scenes, as many existing scenes were created using this specific model. While larger models may offer more intelligence, 7B models like Silicon Maid and Loyal Macaroni Maid are often sufficient for roleplay.

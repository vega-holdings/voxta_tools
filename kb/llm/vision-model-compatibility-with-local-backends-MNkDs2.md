# Vision Model Compatibility with Local Backends

> llama.cpp and Ollama have limited support for specific vision model architectures.

## Answer

Local inference backends like `llama.cpp` and `ollama` do not support all vision system architectures. If a vision model is failing or behaving unexpectedly, it may be because the specific inference engine does not yet support that model's vision projector or architecture.

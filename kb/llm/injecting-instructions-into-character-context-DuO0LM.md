# Injecting Instructions into Character Context

> Use bracketed messages to insert instructions or thoughts into a character's context.

## Answer

You can guide a character's behavior or 'put ideas into their head' by sending a message enclosed in brackets. This acts as a direction for the LLM.

**Example:**
`[{{char}} does not want to play a game and wants to go to the study]`

The brackets `[]` are essential for this technique to work effectively.

# Generating Non-Speech Sounds (Moans/Laughs) with TTS

> Clarification that current TTS models do not natively generate non-speech sounds like moans.

## Answer

Current Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation mechanisms are primarily designed for speech only. Models like Coqui (XTTS) and Silero generally do not generate non-speech sounds (like moans or laughs) effectively during text generation.

*Note: For specific sound effects, Voxta supports [App Triggers](https://doc.voxta.ai/docs/app-triggers/) to play pre-recorded audio files from character assets.*

# Vision Service Motion Tracking Capabilities

> Voxta uses still images for vision but can simulate motion tracking with multimodal models by comparing previous frames.

## Answer

Voxta primarily processes still images. However, for supported multimodal models, the system pushes the previous vision data along with the current still. This allows the model to highlight differences and infer a limited sense of movement or change. This feature is experimental and does not work with the Florence-2 model.

# NSFW Chat Support and Filters

> NSFW support depends on the selected LLM and prompts, not a Voxta-specific filter.

## Answer

NSFW capabilities depend entirely on the **LLM (Large Language Model)** and **Prompts** used. Voxta does not have an internal filter that blocks responses completely.

*   **Models:** Select an LLM known for uncensored roleplay. Official documentation recommends models like `Loyal-Macaroni-Maid-7B` or `MLewd-L2-Chat-13B` for roleplay capabilities.
*   **Silence:** If the AI stops responding during NSFW topics, it is likely a technical issue or a specific model refusal behavior, not a Voxta app filter blocking the connection.
*   **Local vs Cloud:** You do not strictly need to be local, but local LLMs generally offer the most control over content restrictions compared to commercial APIs like OpenAI.

# Simplified LLM Sampling Strategy using Min P

> A user suggests using Min P at 0.12 and Temperature at 0.7 while disabling other samplers for good results.

## Answer

A simplified strategy for LLM sampling parameters involves disabling most parameters and relying primarily on **Min P** and **Temperature**.

Suggested settings:
* **Min P**: `0.12`
* **Temperature**: `0.7` (Adjust higher or lower depending on the model and desired creativity/randomness).

# Monitoring OpenRouter API Activity

> Use the OpenRouter Activity dashboard to inspect API call details and routing providers.

## Answer

You can view detailed logs of your OpenRouter API calls, including which provider routed the request (e.g., Parasail), by visiting the [OpenRouter Activity page](https://openrouter.ai/activity). This is useful for troubleshooting connection issues or verifying which models are actually handling your requests.

# Troubleshooting FFmpegDemuxer and PIPELINE_ERROR_READ Audio Errors

> This error indicates a generic audio playback failure often caused by browser instability, resource constraints, or TTS formatting issues. Resolve it by checking logs, switching browsers, monitoring system resources, or adjusting text generation settings.

## Answer

The `PIPELINE_ERROR_READ: FFmpegDemuxer: data source error` message indicates a client-side playback failure where the audio stream cannot be read correctly. While audio may sometimes play despite the error, it usually signifies an interruption in the media pipeline.

## Diagnosis
To identify the specific root cause, inspect the application logs:

1.  **Press F12** to view the browser/frontend console logs. This is crucial as the error originates in the browser's media pipeline.
2.  **Press F2** to view the Voxta server logs.

*Note: If the browser crashes or the embedded view fails, the error may appear as an overlay in the interface without corresponding entries in the F2 server logs.*

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. Browser Compatibility and XTTS
This error is frequently seen when using **XTTS (Coqui)**, which does not support real-time audio streaming. It can also occur due to general browser instability or incompatibility with the streaming format.

*   **Fix:** Switch to a different web browser. This issue has been confirmed to resolve when changing from Microsoft Edge to **Firefox** or **LibreWolf**.
*   **Fix:** If you are using the embedded browser view, try accessing Voxta through an external browser instead.
*   **Workaround:** Consider using a different TTS service if you require real-time streaming capabilities.

### 2. Resource Constraints
High system load can interrupt audio processing, particularly when running local models.

*   **Check Resources:** Monitor your **VRAM usage** and **GPU load**. If these are maxed out, the audio pipeline may fail to process data in time.

### 3. Text Generation and Formatting
TTS engines may struggle with specific output formats generated by the LLM, leading to pipeline errors.

*   **Adjust System Prompt:** Modify your text generation settings to help the TTS engine process the input:
    *   Break long paragraphs into shorter, separate lines.
    *   Alternatively, force the response into a single continuous paragraph.

### 4. Isolate the Issue
To determine if the problem is specific to your client setup:
*   Use the **[Voxta Playground](https://doc.voxta.ai/docs/playgrounds/)** to test if the error is reproducible in a controlled environment.

## Additional Tips
*   Ensure your browser is up to date, as newer versions often include improved media handling and stability fixes.

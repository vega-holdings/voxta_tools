# Ghost typing or automatic user inputs

> Automatic typing in the user input field is likely caused by auto-continuation settings or microphone audio bleed.

## Answer

This behavior is often caused by **Auto-continuation** settings. If enabled, the system may automatically generate user responses to keep the conversation going.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Disable Auto-continuation:** Check your settings and turn off auto-continuation to prevent the system from generating user inputs automatically.
2. **Check Audio Bleed:** If Voice-to-Text is active, ensure your microphone is not picking up the character's audio output. This can cause the system to transcribe the character's voice as user input.

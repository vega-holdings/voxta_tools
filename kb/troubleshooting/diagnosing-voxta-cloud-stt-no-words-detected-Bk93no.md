# Diagnosing Voxta Cloud STT "No words detected"

> Switch to Local STT to verify microphone functionality when Cloud STT fails.

## Answer

To determine if the issue is with your hardware or the Voxta Cloud service, try switching to **Local STT**. 

If Local STT works and detects speech correctly, your microphone and app permissions are functioning properly. This indicates the issue is likely specific to the Voxta Cloud STT service (server-side) rather than your local setup.

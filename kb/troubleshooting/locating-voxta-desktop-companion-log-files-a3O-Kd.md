# Locating Voxta Desktop Companion Log Files

> Path to the player.log file used for debugging Voxta Desktop Companion.

## Answer

The `player.log` file is located in the Windows AppData folder:

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Voxta-Inc\VoxtaDesktopCompanion`

**Note:** `AppData` is a hidden folder by default. You must enable "Hidden items" in the Windows Explorer "View" tab to navigate to it manually.

# Error caused by missing webcam when capture is enabled

> Enabling webcam capture without a connected camera causes errors; disable the setting to resolve.

## Answer

If **Webcam Capture** is enabled in the settings but no webcam is physically attached or detected by the system, Voxta will generate an error. To fix this, disable the webcam capture option in the settings.

# Voxta Server Startup Failure (Log File Lock)

> Delete Voxta-log in Data folder to fix startup issues.

## Answer

One potential solution is to delete the `Voxta-log` file located in the `Data` folder. This file can sometimes prevent the application from running if it is locked or corrupted from a previous session.

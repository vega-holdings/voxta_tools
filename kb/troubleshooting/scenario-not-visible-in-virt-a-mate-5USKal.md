# Scenario not visible in Virt-A-Mate

> Ensure the Scenario App setting is set to Virt-A-Mate for visibility.

## Answer

If the Voxta/VAM plugin is connected but a specific scenario is not appearing, check the **App** setting in the scenario configuration. 

1. Open the Scenario in Voxta.
2. Go to the **General** tab.
3. Ensure the **App** field is set to `Virt-A-Mate`.

This setting filters scenarios so they only appear for the intended client application.

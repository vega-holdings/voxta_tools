# Voxy Client Compatibility with Voxta Server 149

> Voxy versions newer than beta.22 require Voxta Server 150 due to API changes.

## Answer

This issue occurs because newer versions of Voxy (released after beta.22) are designed for Voxta Server 150+ due to API changes.

**Solution:**
Downgrade Voxy to **beta.22** if you are still running Voxta Server 149.

# ElevenLabs TTS Test Button Returns No Result

> The ElevenLabs Test button in Manage Modules may fail even if the service is working; verify using the Voice Playground instead.

## Answer

The 'Test' button in the Manage Modules section can sometimes be unreliable or fail to play back audio even when the configuration is correct. 

**Recommended Verification Steps:**
1. Check your ElevenLabs transaction history to confirm the API received the request (e.g., a generated "Hi").
2. Use the **Voice Playground** or interact with the AI assistant directly to test the audio.

If audio plays in the Playground or chat, the integration is working correctly despite the error in the Manage Modules test.

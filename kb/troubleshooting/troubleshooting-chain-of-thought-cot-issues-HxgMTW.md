# Troubleshooting Chain of Thought (CoT) Issues

> Steps to diagnose missing or inconsistent Chain of Thought generation including checking diagnostics, logs, and the Inspector.

## Answer

If Chain of Thought is inconsistent or missing, perform the following checks:

1. **Settings:** Verify your Chain of Thought settings.
2. **Diagnostics:** Check the Diagnostics panel to see what the system attempted to do; the LLM might be unable to perform the specific task.
3. **Logs:** Review system logs for any error messages indicating failure.
4. **Inspector:** You can verify if CoT is being generated by looking in the **Inspector** under the **Context** category.

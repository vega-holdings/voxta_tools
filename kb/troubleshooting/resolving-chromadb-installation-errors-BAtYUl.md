# Resolving ChromaDB Installation Errors

> Fix ChromaDB errors by deleting the referenced files and reinstalling the service.

## Answer

If you encounter persistent ChromaDB errors referencing specific file paths, try the following steps:

1. Navigate to the file path indicated in the error message.
2. Delete the Chroma-related files or folders found there.
3. Reinstall Chroma (typically by running the 'Run All Installers' option in Voxta's Manage Services tab to ensure dependencies are correctly refreshed).

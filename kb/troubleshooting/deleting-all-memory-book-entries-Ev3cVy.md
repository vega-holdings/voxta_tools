# Deleting All Memory Book Entries

> Clarification on memory list pagination and how to fully delete a memory book.

## Answer

The Memory Entries list in the UI is often paginated (e.g., displaying only ~14 entries per page). Deleting the visible entries on the current page does not automatically delete entries on subsequent pages.

**Solutions:**
*   Navigate through all pages to delete entries manually.
*   Use the **Delete memory book** button located at the bottom of the interface to wipe the entire memory book at once.

# Fixing issues with long-running conversations

> Long conversations may break over time; starting a fresh chat and converting history to memory entries resolves this.

## Answer

Long-running conversations may eventually encounter issues, potentially due to context window limits or state issues. A proven workaround is to abandon the problematic conversation and start a fresh one. 

To preserve the context of the old conversation, you can summarize important details into **Memory** entries before starting the new chat.

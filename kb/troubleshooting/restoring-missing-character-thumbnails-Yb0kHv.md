# Restoring Missing Character Thumbnails

> Fix missing character thumbnails (black boxes) by re-uploading the image via the character edit menu.

## Answer

If character thumbnails appear as black boxes and the browser console reports 404 errors for the resources, the image links may be broken.

**Solution:**
1. Go to the **Characters** tab in Voxta.
2. Click the three dots (`...`) on the affected character card.
3. Select **Edit**.
4. Click the image placeholder.
5. Re-upload the image from your local files.
6. Click **Save**.

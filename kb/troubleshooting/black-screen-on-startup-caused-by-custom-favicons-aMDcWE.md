# Black screen on startup caused by custom favicons

> Replacing original favicons can cause a black screen on startup.

## Answer

This issue can be caused by replacing the original Voxta favicons with custom ones. If you encounter a black screen on startup after an upgrade or customization, ensure the original favicon files are restored to the installation directory.

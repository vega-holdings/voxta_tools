# False Positive Error Testing Voxta Cloud Vision

> The 'profile not configured' error during testing may be a false positive when using Voxta Cloud Vision.

## Answer

This error is often a false positive and can be ignored if the services are otherwise functioning. It typically occurs because a specific diagnostic test for Vision is not yet implemented in the testing suite, which may cause the system to report a configuration error during the check. Verify if Vision works in actual usage despite the error.

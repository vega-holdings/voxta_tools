# Downloading Images from Discord Client

> Use the Discord Desktop Client to save images to ensure correct file types.

## Answer

When downloading images (such as character cards) from Discord, it is recommended to right-click the image within the Discord Desktop Client and save it. This ensures the file is downloaded with the correct file type and extension, avoiding potential format conversion issues often encountered when downloading via web browsers.

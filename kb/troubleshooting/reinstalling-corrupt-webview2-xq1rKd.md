# Reinstalling Corrupt WebView2

> Uninstall corrupt WebView2 via Add/Remove programs before attempting to reinstall.

## Answer

If you suspect the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is corrupt and the installer refuses to run (claiming it is already installed), follow these steps:

1. Go to Windows **Add or remove programs**.
2. Locate **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime** and uninstall it.
3. Download the installer from the [official Microsoft Developer site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH).
4. Run the installer again.

# Verifying Microphone Input Signal

> Check microphone activity via the volume bar in the Speech to Text module settings.

## Answer

To verify if Voxta is picking up microphone audio, navigate to **Manage Modules** > **Speech to Text**. Look for the volume bar, which indicates if the microphone is active and displays the current input volume level.

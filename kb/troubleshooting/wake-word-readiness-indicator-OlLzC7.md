# Wake Word Readiness Indicator

> Wait for the microphone icon to turn blue before using the wake word.

## Answer

When using Azure On-Device Wake Word (e.g., combined with Whisper Live), you must wait for the microphone icon in the Voxta interface to turn **blue** before speaking the wake word. The blue indicator confirms that the wake word detection service is fully initialized and listening.

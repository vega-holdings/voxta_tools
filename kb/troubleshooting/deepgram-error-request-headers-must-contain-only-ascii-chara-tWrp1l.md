# Deepgram Error: Request headers must contain only ASCII characters

> Resolving Deepgram API key errors related to non-ASCII characters in headers.

## Answer

This error typically indicates that the Deepgram API key entered in the configuration contains non-ASCII characters (such as hidden formatting, emojis, or invalid symbols).

**Solution:**
1. Navigate to **Services** (or Manage Modules) in Voxta.
2. Check the Deepgram configuration.
3. Clear the API key field and re-paste the key, ensuring no extra spaces or hidden characters are included.
4. Ensure the key is plain text.

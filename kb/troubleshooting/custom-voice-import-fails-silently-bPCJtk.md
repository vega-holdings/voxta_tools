# Custom Voice Import Fails Silently

> Workaround for failed voice imports by manually copying files to the Data directory.

## Answer

If the in-app importer fails, try manually copying the voice files directly into the appropriate subdirectories within the `Voxta/Data` folder instead of dropping them into the Voxta app importer.

# Workaround for Hebrew Character Errors in Voice Modules

> Use English samples or text if Hebrew characters cause errors in voice modules.

## Answer

Certain voice models or modules may not recognize Hebrew characters, leading to errors. A verified workaround is to use English text or generate an English audio sample (e.g., using Coqui) instead. The module likely requires input in a supported script (typically Latin/English) to function correctly.

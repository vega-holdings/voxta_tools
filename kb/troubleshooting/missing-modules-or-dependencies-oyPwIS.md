# Missing Modules or Dependencies

> Ensure modules are selected in the Wizard to automatically install required dependencies.

## Answer

Missing functionality is often due to modules not being selected during the initial Wizard setup. If you select the required modules in the Wizard, Voxta should automatically install all necessary dependencies for them.

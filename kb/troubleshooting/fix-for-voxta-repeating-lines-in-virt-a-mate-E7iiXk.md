# Fix for Voxta Repeating Lines in Virt-A-Mate

> Restart the Virt-A-Mate scene to fix audio/text repetition loops.

## Answer

If Voxta begins repeating the first line on a loop while integrated with Virt-A-Mate, try restarting the scene in Virt-A-Mate. This has been reported to resolve the repetition issue when other fixes fail.

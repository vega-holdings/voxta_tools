# Deepgram 401 Authentication Error

> Fixing Deepgram 401 errors by regenerating and updating the API key.

## Answer

A 401 error indicates an authentication failure, which typically means the Deepgram service is not properly configured or the API key is invalid/expired.

**Resolution:**
1. Generate a new API key on the [Deepgram website](https://deepgram.com/).
2. Open Voxta and navigate to **Services**.
3. Update the Deepgram service entry with the new API key.

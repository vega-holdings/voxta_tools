# Troubleshooting Patreon Login and Discord Sync Delays

> Steps to resolve login issues caused by delays in Patreon-Discord linking, including forcing a sync, refreshing the link, and waiting.

## Answer

# Troubleshooting Patreon Login and Discord Sync Delays

It is common to experience delays when linking your Patreon account to Discord, especially after subscribing or updating your membership. These delays are caused by the Patreon API and can range from a few minutes to several hours, particularly during high-traffic periods.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Wait a few minutes** – In most cases, the synchronization completes automatically within a short time. If you've just linked your accounts or changed your subscription, give the system a few minutes to update.

2. **Force a sync via the Voxta portal** – Visit [portal.voxta.ai](https://portal.voxta.ai/) and click the **Sync With Patreon** button. This will immediately request an update from Patreon and apply any changes to your Discord roles.

3. **Refresh the Discord link in Patreon settings** – Go to your [Patreon settings](https://www.patreon.com/settings/profile) and click the Discord link button again. This will refresh the connection between Patreon and Discord. For a more thorough refresh, you can disconnect your Discord account and then reconnect it.

4. **Wait longer if needed** – Occasionally, delays can extend to several hours. If you've tried the steps above and still don't have access, please wait a few hours and check again.

5. **Contact support** – If the problem persists after waiting and attempting the above steps, reach out to Lapiro via Direct Message on Discord for further assistance.

For more information on linking Patreon and Discord, refer to [Patreon's official guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access).

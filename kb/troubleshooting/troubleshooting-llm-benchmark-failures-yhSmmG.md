# Troubleshooting LLM Benchmark Failures

> Benchmark failures usually indicate an unsuitable model rather than bad settings.

## Answer

If a model fails the benchmarks, it often indicates the model itself is unsuitable rather than a configuration issue. While you can attempt to tune the specific presets, it is generally recommended to try a different model that is better suited for Voxta's requirements (instruction following and roleplay) before spending time fine-tuning settings.

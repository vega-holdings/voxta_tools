# Orpheus TTS Zero-Shot Voice Cloning Quality Issues

> Orpheus TTS currently struggles with Zero-Shot voice cloning accuracy and may produce hallucinations.

## Answer

Users report that the current Orpheus model has inherent issues with Zero-Shot voice cloning, often resulting in output that does not resemble the reference samples. Symptoms may also include erratic behavior or specific hallucinations (e.g., repeating phrases like "I'm sorry if I've invaded your privacy").

This appears to be a model-specific limitation rather than a configuration error. The recommended workaround is to wait for a model update or use alternative TTS engines like Coqui.

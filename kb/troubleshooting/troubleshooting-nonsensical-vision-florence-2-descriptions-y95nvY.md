# Troubleshooting Nonsensical Vision/Florence-2 Descriptions

> Check monitor selection in Windows SDK and verify correct usage of screenshot vs attachment features.

## Answer

If vision descriptions seem unrelated to your intended target, check the following:

1. **Multi-Monitor Configuration**: If using a multi-monitor setup, verify the selected monitor in the **Windows SDK** settings. The system may be capturing the wrong screen.
2. **Feature Usage**: Ensure you are using the correct feature for your goal. Use the **Attachment** feature for analyzing specific image files, and the **Screenshot** feature for analyzing the current screen content.

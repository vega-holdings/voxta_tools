# Fix for Audio Looping in Pre-packaged Scenes

> Disable the loop setting in Person Head Audio to fix looping issues in scenes.

## Answer

This issue is often caused by the **loop** setting being enabled in the **Person Head Audio** section of the scene.

**Solution:**
1. Select the Person atom in the scene.
2. Navigate to the **Head Audio** section.
3. Ensure the **loop** setting is switched **OFF**.

Some pre-packaged scenes may have this setting enabled by default, which causes the audio to repeat indefinitely.

# Connection issues after PC sleep mode

> Fixing connection links lost after PC sleep mode by rebooting or adjusting power settings.

## Answer

Connection issues often arise due to power management settings in Windows or the BIOS disrupting the link when the computer enters sleep mode.

**Resolution:**
* Reboot the computer.
* Reboot the Quest headset.
* Review power management settings to ensure network or link services are not disabled during sleep.

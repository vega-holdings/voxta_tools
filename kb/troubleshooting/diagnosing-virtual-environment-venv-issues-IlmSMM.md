# Diagnosing Virtual Environment (venv) Issues

> Run Voxta from the OS terminal to view venv configuration logs.

## Answer

Run Voxta directly from the operating system terminal (command line) rather than using a shortcut or GUI launcher. Watch the console output during startup; if the `venv` is not active or configured, a specific log entry will appear indicating this status.

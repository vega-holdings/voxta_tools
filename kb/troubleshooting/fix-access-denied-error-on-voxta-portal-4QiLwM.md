# Fix 'access_denied' Error on Voxta Cloud Portal

> Resolve access_denied errors when logging into the Voxta portal by verifying your Patreon email address and ensuring you have an active Voxta Patreon subscription.

## Answer

# Fix 'access_denied' Error on Voxta Portal

If you see an `access_denied` error when trying to log into the [Voxta Cloud Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/), it's usually due to one of two reasons:

1. **Your Patreon email address is not verified.**  
   The error message may include: `"error_description":"Please verify your email address through Patreon before logging in."`

2. **You do not have an active Voxta Patreon subscription.**  
   Access to the portal requires an active pledge to a Voxta tier on Patreon.

## How to Resolve

### 1. Verify Your Patreon Email Address
- Go to [Patreon.com](https://www.patreon.com) and log in.
- Navigate to your account settings and ensure your email address is verified. If not, follow Patreon's verification process.
- After verification, try logging into the portal again.

### 2. Ensure an Active Patreon Subscription
- Check that your Patreon subscription to Voxta is active and the payment has processed successfully.
- If your subscription has lapsed or you haven't pledged, visit the [Voxta Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/voxta) and select a tier.
- Once your subscription is active, you should be able to log in.

If you continue to experience issues, contact Voxta support for further assistance.

# USB Audio Device Reliability

> Observation regarding the reliability of USB audio devices vs Oculus mic.

## Answer

When troubleshooting audio input, note that generic USB audio devices can sometimes be problematic or "troublesome" compared to other inputs. However, the Oculus microphone is reported to work correctly even when used via a USB cable connection.

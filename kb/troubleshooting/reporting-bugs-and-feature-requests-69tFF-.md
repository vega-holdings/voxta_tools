# Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

> Post bug reports and feature requests in the dedicated Discord channels rather than tagging the developer.

## Answer

The most effective way to report bugs or request features is to post in the dedicated channels on the Voxta Discord (specifically the bug reports or feature requests channels). 

The main developer reviews all items posted in these channels. It is recommended to avoid tagging the developer directly in general chat and instead use these specific channels to ensure the issue is tracked and addressed.

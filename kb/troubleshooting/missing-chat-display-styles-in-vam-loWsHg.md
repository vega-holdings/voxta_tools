# Missing Chat Display Styles in VAM

> Chat display styles vary based on the character type (Storytelling, Roleplay, Assistant, etc.).

## Answer

The visibility of chat styles depends on the **Character Type** configured:

*   **Storytelling**: Shows `Full` and `Avatar` modes.
*   **Roleplay** and **Companion**: Shows all modes (`Talk`, `Avatar`, `Full`).
*   **Assistant**: Shows `Assistant` mode.
*   **Other types**: Generally show all modes.

If you are missing options, check the type of character you are using.

# Microphone stops listening after one response

> Diagnostic steps for when the microphone stops capturing audio after a single interaction.

## Answer

To diagnose this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check the Transcription Playground**: Go to the **Playground** section (Speech to Text) to visualize when the microphone is active and listening. This helps confirm if the input is being detected consistently.
2. **Verify Listening Settings**: Check the **Profile & Settings** panel (bottom right) to ensure the "listening" toggle is enabled.
3. **Check Module Configuration**: Navigate to **Manage Module** -> **Speech Transcription** -> **Configure** to verify that the Voxta Cloud service is correctly selected and configured.

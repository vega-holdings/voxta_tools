# Fixing Repeating Sounds or Scene Issues

> Troubleshooting steps for repeating sounds or glitches in scenes.

## Answer

First, try deleting the problematic sounds, creating a new save of the scene, and reloading. If the issue persists, the scene itself may be bugged; users have reported that switching to a different scene often resolves these repeating issues when they are scene-specific.

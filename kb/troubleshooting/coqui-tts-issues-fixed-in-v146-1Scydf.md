# Coqui TTS Issues Fixed in v146

> Updating to Voxta v146 resolves reported issues with Coqui TTS.

## Answer

Updating Voxta to version 146 (or later) has been reported to resolve issues with the Coqui TTS service.

**To update Voxta safely:**
1. Download the latest release from the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai).
2. Extract the files to a **new empty folder** (do not overwrite the existing installation).
3. Copy the `Data` folder from the previous version to the new one to preserve settings.
4. Launch the new version and click `Run All Installers` under **Manage Services** to ensure Python dependencies are updated.

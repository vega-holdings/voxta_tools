# Verifying GPU Usage and Startup Logs

> Use the F2 terminal to monitor GPU usage and startup logs.

## Answer

To verify if Voxta is utilizing the GPU correctly or to diagnose startup issues, press `F2` to open the Voxta terminal. This log window provides real-time updates on service initiation and performance metrics during the first start or when accessing the playground.

# DeepSpeed causing chat failures or slowness

> Disabling DeepSpeed can fix issues where the LLM fails to respond or is slow.

## Answer

Disabling DeepSpeed in your LLM backend configuration can resolve issues where the AI fails to respond or performs poorly. One user reported that switching off DeepSpeed completely resolved their inability to chat.

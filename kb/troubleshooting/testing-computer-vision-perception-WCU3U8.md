# Testing Computer Vision Perception

> Ask the character 'What do you see?' to verify Computer Vision functionality.

## Answer

To verify what the AI sees through Computer Vision:
1. Ensure the **Screen** input is enabled (and camera/eye tracking disabled if not needed).
2. Ask the character directly, "What do you see?"

This confirms if the AI is receiving the visual data correctly.

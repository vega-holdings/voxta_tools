# Characters repeating phrases from voice samples

> Characters may repeat phrases found at the end of voice training samples.

## Answer

This behavior can occur if the specific phrase appears at the end of the voice training samples used for the character. The model may inadvertently reproduce these ending words from the training data. To fix this, review your voice samples and trim or remove the recurring phrases.

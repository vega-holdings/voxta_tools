# Fix for Black Screen Transparency Issue

> Reset Nvidia driver settings to default to resolve black screen transparency issues.

## Answer

This issue may be caused by custom Nvidia driver settings (often modified for specific games). 

**Solution:**
Reset your Nvidia driver settings to their default values. While the specific conflicting setting is not always clear, restoring global defaults has been confirmed to resolve the transparency issue.

# Chat Image Generation Resolution Issues

> Changing chat image generation resolution to unsupported formats (like 1280x720) causes failures; revert to defaults/square.

## Answer

Issues with chat image generation can occur if the resolution in the Settings preset is changed to an unsupported format. Specifically, resolutions like `1280 x 720` may cause failures. 

**Solution:**
* Revert the resolution in your Settings preset to the default (typically square).
* Avoid using unsupported aspect ratios for chat image generation.

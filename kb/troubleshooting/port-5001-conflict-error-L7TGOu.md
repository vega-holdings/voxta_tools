# Port 5001 Conflict Error

> Simultaneous execution of client and server may cause port 5001 conflicts.

## Answer

Running both the client and server (or multiple instances) at the same time can cause a port conflict, as they may both attempt to use port **5001**. Ensure you are not running conflicting instances simultaneously.

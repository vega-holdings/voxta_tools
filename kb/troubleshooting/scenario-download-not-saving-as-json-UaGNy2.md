# Scenario Download Not Saving as JSON

> Workaround for scenario downloads not saving as JSON by removing the avatar.

## Answer

To download a scenario, click the three dots in the bottom right of the Scenario section and select **Download**. 

If the resulting file is not a JSON file, delete the avatar image associated with the scenario and try downloading it again.

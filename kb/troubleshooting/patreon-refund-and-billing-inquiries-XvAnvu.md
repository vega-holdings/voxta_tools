# Patreon Refund and Billing Inquiries

> Official policy prohibits refunds, but users suggest DMing @lapiro for billing disputes.

## Answer

According to official documentation, once a Patreon Tier is unlocked and perks are available, there is **no option for a refund**. However, for specific billing disputes or accidental renewals, community members suggest contacting `@lapiro` directly via Discord DM to discuss the issue.

# Verifying Truncated Text from KoboldAI

> Check the KoboldAI console window to see the full text generation if Voxta appears to cut the response short.

## Answer

Voxta may sometimes display less text than what the backend actually generates. To confirm if the text was truncated by the interface, check the **KoboldAI command prompt window**. The console shows the full raw generation from the model, which may continue past the point where Voxta stopped displaying the response.

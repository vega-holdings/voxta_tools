# Deepgram Service Not Working

> Check Deepgram account funds if the service stops working.

## Answer

If your configuration is correct, you may have run out of funds or credits on your Deepgram account. 

1. Log in to the [Deepgram Dashboard](https://deepgram.com/) to check your balance.
2. Verify your API key in Voxta under the **Services** (or Manage Modules) menu in the Deepgram configuration.

# Monitoring Token Usage via Chat Inspector

> View used tokens in the chat inspector to monitor context usage.

## Answer

To monitor token usage, navigate to the **inspector** within the chat interface. You can view the 'used' tokens there. This metric is helpful for understanding when summarization might occur, which is determined by your summarization settings and the total context size.

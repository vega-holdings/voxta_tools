# Editing and Deleting Messages in Voxta Build 137+

> Instructions on how to access edit/delete message options in the new UI (Build 137+).

## Answer

In Voxta build 137 and later, the interface for managing messages has changed. To access options for editing or deleting messages (both User and AI):

* Click the **character's picture** associated with the message.
* Alternatively, click the **lightning bolt icon**.

These actions will reveal the menu to modify the chat history.

# Florence Model Installation Blocked by Windows Security

> Disable 'Potentially unwanted app blocking' in Windows Security to fix Florence installation issues.

## Answer

Windows Security settings may block the installation of the Florence model. To resolve this:

1. Open **Windows Security**.
2. Navigate to **App & browser control** > **Reputation-based protection**.
3. Disable **Potentially unwanted app blocking**.

Users have reported that disabling this specific setting allows the installation to proceed while keeping the main firewall enabled.

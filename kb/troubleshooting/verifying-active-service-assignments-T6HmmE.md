# Verifying Active Service Assignments

> Check the right-side panel to ensure an active service is assigned to every required category.

## Answer

Open the right-side panel in the Voxta interface. This panel displays categories for each required service type (such as LLM, TTS, STT). Ensure that there is an active service attached to every category. If you are running a local setup but only see cloud services (like OpenRouter or Voxta Cloud), verify that your local services are installed and assigned correctly in these categories.

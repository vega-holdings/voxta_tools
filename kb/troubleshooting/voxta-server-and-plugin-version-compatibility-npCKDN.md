# Voxta Server and Plugin Version Compatibility

> Match plugin versions to server versions; legacy mappings are not tracked.

## Answer

If you are using an older version of Voxta Server, you must use the specific plugin version that matches that server release. The team does not track specific legacy version mappings, so it is recommended to keep both server and plugin updated to the latest versions.

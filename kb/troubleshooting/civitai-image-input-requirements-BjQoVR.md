# Civitai Image Input Requirements

> Resize images to standard resolutions/ratios if Civitai rejects them.

## Answer

Civitai has strict requirements regarding image ratio, format, and resolution. If the input is failing, try resizing the picture or adjusting the aspect ratio to a standard format.

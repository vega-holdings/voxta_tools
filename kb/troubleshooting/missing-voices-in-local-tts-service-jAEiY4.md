# Missing Voices in Local TTS Service

> Reinstall the TTS module if new voices are missing after an update.

## Answer

If new voices are missing after an update or installation, try reinstalling the specific TTS module (Service). 

1. Go to the **Services** or **Manage Services** section in Voxta.
2. Locate the TTS service (e.g., Kokoro TTS).
3. Reinstall the service/module.

This often resolves issues where voice definitions or files were not correctly registered during the initial setup.

# Text Generation Service UI Status Indicators

> Explains that the Text Generation service UI indicators (toggles and buttons) may not turn green to show active status. Users should rely on toggle position or actual functionality to verify service availability.

## Answer

### Visual Indicator Behavior
The visual indicators for the Text Generation service, including toggle switches and buttons, may not turn green even when the service is installed, available, and active. This is considered normal behavior and is a known visual quirk in the user interface.

### Determining Service Status
Because the color indicator may be unreliable, use the following methods to verify the service status:

*   **Toggle Position:** If using a toggle switch, check its position. If the toggle is positioned to the **right**, the service is enabled, regardless of the color.
*   **Functional Testing:** Do not rely solely on the UI color. Verify that the service is working by attempting to generate text or interact with the feature directly.

The lack of green coloration does not indicate that the service is inactive or broken.

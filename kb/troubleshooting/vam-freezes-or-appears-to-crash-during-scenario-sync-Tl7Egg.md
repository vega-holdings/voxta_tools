# VAM Freezes or Appears to Crash During Scenario Sync

> VAM may temporarily freeze or appear to crash during scenario synchronization; this is usually normal processing.

## Answer

When syncing or creating a new scenario from VAM to Voxta, you may encounter a pause where VAM becomes unresponsive and appears to have crashed. 

This is often normal processing behavior. 
1. Wait for the process to complete.
2. Check the Voxta interface to confirm the new scenario has appeared.
3. If the issue persists or the scenario never appears, verify which specific scene is causing the issue.

# Local Python Environment Location

> Location of the embedded Python installation folder.

## Answer

The local embedded Python environment for Voxta is typically located in the `Data/Python/` directory, specifically in a versioned folder such as `python-3.12.9-amd64`. Users troubleshooting Python dependency issues should check this folder for required files (e.g., `python3.dll`).

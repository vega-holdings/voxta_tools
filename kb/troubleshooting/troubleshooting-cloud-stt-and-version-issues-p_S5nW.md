# Troubleshooting Cloud STT and Version Issues

> Fixes for Cloud STT issues in version 1.2.1 and general console troubleshooting.

## Answer

To troubleshoot STT issues:
1. Open the diagnostic console by pressing `F2` to check for specific error messages.
2. Verify which STT service is currently active.
3. If using **Voxta Cloud STT**, ensure you have updated to version **1.2.1** (or later), as this release fixes specific issues with the cloud service.

*Note: Ensure you are referencing a valid version number (e.g., version 1.4.2 did not exist at the time of this discussion).*

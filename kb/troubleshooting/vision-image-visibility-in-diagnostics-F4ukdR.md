# Vision Image Visibility in Diagnostics

> Image captures may not display in Diagnostics when using Voxy.

## Answer

Users have observed that while image captures are typically visible in the Diagnostics (inspect) view during standard testing, they may not appear in the view when running through Voxy, even if the feature is functioning.

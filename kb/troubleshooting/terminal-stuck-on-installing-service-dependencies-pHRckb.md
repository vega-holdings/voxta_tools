# Terminal stuck on installing service dependencies

> Possible causes for the terminal hanging during dependency installation.

## Answer

If the terminal hangs at the 'installing all service dependencies' stage without the progress percentage changing for a long time (e.g., 3 hours), it is likely stuck. Common causes include:

*   **Unstable or slow internet connection:** The download process may have timed out or hung.
*   **Insufficient storage space:** Ensure the drive has enough space for the dependencies (though this usually triggers an error).

Check your internet connection and disk space, then try restarting the process.

# VAM Apartment Scene Not Starting

> Fix for VAM apartment scene not starting due to duplicate plugin versions.

## Answer

This issue is often caused by having conflicting versions of the Voxta plugin installed simultaneously in Virt-A-Mate.

**Solution:**
1. Check your Virt-A-Mate `AddonPackages` folder.
2. Ensure only the latest version of the Voxta plugin is present.
3. Delete any older versions of the plugin.

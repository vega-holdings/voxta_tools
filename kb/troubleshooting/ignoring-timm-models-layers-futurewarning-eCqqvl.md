# Ignoring timm.models.layers FutureWarning

> The `timm.models.layers` FutureWarning during startup is harmless and can be ignored.

## Answer

This is a warning from the Python dependency `timm` regarding future code changes. It does not affect the current functionality of Voxta and can be safely ignored.

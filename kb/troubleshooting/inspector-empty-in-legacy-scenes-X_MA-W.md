# Inspector Empty in Legacy Scenes

> Legacy scenes may not display data in the Inspector due to architectural changes in Voxta.

## Answer

Legacy scenes (such as the BJ scene) were built differently compared to modern Voxta standards. Due to significant changes in the software over time, these older scenes may not populate the Inspector (Flags and Variables) correctly, even if inference is technically working.

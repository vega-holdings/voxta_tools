# SFX Error Spam: Failed to play audio effect

> Identifies the "Failed to play audio effect" spam after SFX playback as a known bug.

## Answer

This is a known bug where the audio plays correctly, but the UI erroneously reports a failure in a loop afterwards. The developer has confirmed this issue and indicated it will be addressed in a future build.

# F5-TTS Test Button Error

> The F5-TTS test button is buggy; test in real chat instead.

## Answer

The 'Test' button in the F5-TTS configuration is currently known to be buggy and may return false errors. It is recommended to test the TTS functionality directly in the real chat interface to verify if it is working properly.

# Fix for VaM Character Talking But Not Moving

> Resolve issues with characters not moving by removing duplicate/older versions of the Voxta plugin var.

## Answer

This issue is often caused by having multiple versions of the Voxta plugin installed simultaneously in Virt-A-Mate (VaM).

**Solution:**
1. Check your VaM installation for `acidbubbles.Voxta.var` files.
2. Delete **ALL** older versions of the plugin.
3. Keep only the newest version (e.g., version 69 or later) downloaded from the hub.

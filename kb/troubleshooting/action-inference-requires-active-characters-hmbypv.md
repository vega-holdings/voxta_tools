# Action Inference Requires Active Characters

> Action inference fails if all characters are disabled as it is designed for character use only.

## Answer

Action inference is designed specifically for AI characters to determine their actions based on the conversation, not for the user. If all characters in the session are disabled, action inference will not function because there is no active character to trigger the actions.

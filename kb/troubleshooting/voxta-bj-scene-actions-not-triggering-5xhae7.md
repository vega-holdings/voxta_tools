# Voxta BJ Scene Actions Not Triggering

> Fix for Voxta BJ scene actions not working by updating the embedded plugin.

## Answer

This issue is often caused by a version mismatch between the Voxta Server and the Voxta Plugin in Virt-A-Mate. The pre-made BJ scene may include an older version of the plugin that is incompatible with the current server.

**Solution:**
1. Open the Person/Atom plugins tab in Virt-A-Mate.
2. Remove the old Voxta plugin instance.
3. Add the latest version of the Voxta plugin.

# Orpheus TTS Hallucinations

> Explanation of why generative TTS systems like Orpheus may hallucinate compared to traditional TTS.

## Answer

Orpheus is a generative TTS system based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional TTS systems that strictly synthesize the provided input text, generative systems can occasionally "hallucinate" content or generate unexpected audio. Additionally, the choice of the primary LLM can affect how well rules and tags are followed, which might indirectly influence the input sent to the TTS.

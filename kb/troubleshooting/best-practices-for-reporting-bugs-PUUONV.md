# Best Practices for Reporting Bugs

> Include module setup, LLMs, presets, and hardware specs when reporting bugs.

## Answer

When reporting bugs or issues, providing detailed background information significantly helps developers replicate and fix the problem. 

**Recommended details to include:**
*   **Setup:** Your configuration in "Manage Modules".
*   **LLMs:** Which models you are using.
*   **Settings:** Custom presets or specific parameter settings.
*   **Hardware:** Computer specifications (especially if using local services).

# Resolving Missing Dependencies in Virt-A-Mate

> Use VaMHub's dependency downloader to fix missing assets and verify ALM plugin versions.

## Answer

If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies or plugins (such as `bodylanguage` or Action List Manager): 

1. **Auto-download Dependencies:** Use the dependency download button (often called the "magic button") in the VaMHub interface inside Virt-A-Mate to automatically fetch missing assets.
2. **Check Plugin Versions:** Ensure you are using the correct version of the Action List Manager (ALM) plugin. Some scenes may require the paid version, while others work with the free version. Ensure the plugin is updated.

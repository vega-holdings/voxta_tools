# Microphone Permissions for Voxta and Virt-A-Mate

> Clarifies that only Voxta Server needs microphone permissions, not the VaM client.

## Answer

No, Virt-A-Mate (VaM) does not need to appear in the Windows Microphone usage list. Only `voxta.server` requires microphone access in Windows Privacy & Security settings to function correctly, as it handles the audio input processing.

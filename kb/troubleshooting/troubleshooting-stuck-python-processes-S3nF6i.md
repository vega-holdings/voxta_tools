# Troubleshooting Stuck Python Processes

> Clear residual Python processes via Task Manager or a system restart if services fail.

## Answer

Residual Python processes running in the background can sometimes interfere with Voxta services, preventing them from starting or functioning correctly.

**Solution:**
1. Open **Task Manager**.
2. Check for any running `python` processes.
3. End these tasks manually.
4. Alternatively, restart your computer to ensure all background processes are cleared.

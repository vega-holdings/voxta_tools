# Fixing Character Sync Issues in Virt-A-Mate

> Reselect the character in the VAM plugin or start a new chat to fix potential ID mismatches.

## Answer

If you experience issues with a character in Virt-A-Mate (VAM), try reselecting the character from the Voxta plugin dropdown list or starting a new chat. This can resolve connection issues if the internal character ID has changed or the session needs refreshing.

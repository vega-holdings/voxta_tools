# Service Dependency Installation Incompleteness

> Ensure dependency installation runs until green text appears in the log.

## Answer

A frequent cause is cancelling the "install all services dependencies" process prematurely. You must wait until the **green text** appears in the log to confirm completion. Additionally, carefully review the installation logs for any error messages that may have been overlooked.

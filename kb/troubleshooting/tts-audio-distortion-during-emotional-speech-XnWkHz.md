# TTS Audio Distortion During Emotional Speech

> Local TTS models currently struggle with extreme emotions like shouting, leading to audio distortion.

## Answer

Currently, preventing audio distortion during extreme emotions (shouting, crying) is difficult. Most local Text-to-Speech (TTS) models struggle to interpret and generate these emotions correctly, often resulting in audio artifacts or weird interpretations. While cloud-based solutions like ElevenLabs handle emotional context better, local models generally lack the capability to produce high-quality audio for these specific scenarios at this time.

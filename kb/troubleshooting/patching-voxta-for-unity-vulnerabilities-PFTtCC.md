# Patching Voxta for Unity Vulnerabilities

> Instructions on handling Unity vulnerabilities in Voxta via updates or manual patching.

## Answer

Voxta is built on Unity. While the development team includes security patches in official updates, you can also manually patch your current installation using the official patching tool released by Unity. This allows you to secure the application without waiting for a full version update.

# Troubleshooting Inactive Local Services

> Steps to resolve errors caused by selecting a local service that is not currently running.

## Answer

This error often occurs if a local service is selected in the configuration but is not actually running.

1. Check **Manage Services** (or Manage Modules) to verify the status of your installed services.
2. Open the **Quick Access Menu** (cogwheel icon in the top right) and ensure the correct service provider is selected (e.g., Voxta Cloud vs. a local LLM).
3. If a local service is selected, ensure it is running in the background.

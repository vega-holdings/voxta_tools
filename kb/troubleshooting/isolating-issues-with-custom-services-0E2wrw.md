# Isolating Issues with Custom Services

> Test custom services individually in the playground to isolate errors.

## Answer

When configuring custom services (such as third-party LLMs or TTS), it is recommended to use the playground or test interface to verify them individually. This practice helps pinpoint specific configuration problems before attempting to use the services in a full chat session.

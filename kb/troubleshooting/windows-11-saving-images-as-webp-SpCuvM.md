# Windows 11 Saving Images as WebP

> Windows 11 may force images to save as WebP instead of PNG.

## Answer

Windows 11 may exhibit a behavior where it saves images (such as PNG character cards) as `.webp` files regardless of the browser used. This can prevent the cards from being correctly recognized by Voxta. This is a known Windows issue rather than a Voxta bug.

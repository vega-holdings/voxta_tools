# Voxta Cloud Credits Depleted Quickly

> Explanation of why credits run out quickly (often due to ElevenLabs) and how to replenish them via Patreon upgrades.

## Answer

This message indicates that you have exhausted your Voxta Cloud credits for the current billing cycle. Certain cloud services, particularly high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) providers like **ElevenLabs**, are expensive and can drain credits very quickly compared to text generation.

**Solutions:**
1. **Upgrade Tier:** You can upgrade your Patreon tier to receive more credits immediately. You will be charged the difference and receive a proportionate amount of credits for the remainder of the month.
2. **Monitor Usage:** Visit the [Voxta Portal](https://portal.voxta.ai/) to view service pricing and track exactly where your credits are being spent.
3. **Use Local Services:** If you have a capable GPU, consider running services locally to avoid using cloud credits.

# Access Denied Error for Voxy Desktop Companion

> Voxy Desktop Companion requires the Companion Patreon tier or higher, not the User tier.

## Answer

The **User** tier subscription is insufficient for accessing Voxy Desktop Companion. You must upgrade to the **Companion** tier (the next level up) or higher to access this specific application/release.

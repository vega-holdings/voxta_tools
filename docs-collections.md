# Collections

Collections help you organize characters, scenarios, and other content into logical groups. Access via **Creator Studio > Collections** in the sidebar.

## Overview

As your library of characters and scenarios grows, Collections provide a way to:

- **Group related content** - Keep themed content together
- **Organize by purpose** - Separate work, play, and testing content
- **Quick filtering** - Find content faster
- **Share curated sets** - Export collections as packages

## Interface Elements

### Collection List

The main page displays your collections in a grid or list view:

- **Collection name**
- **Item count** - Number of items in the collection
- **Last modified date**
- **Thumbnail** (if items have images)

### Filters and Sorting

- **Grid/List view toggle** - Switch display mode
- **By date created** - Sort collections by creation date
- **Filter...** search box - Find collections by name
- **Special Filters** - Additional filtering options

### Create Collection

Click the **+ Collection** button (or **+** icon) to create a new collection.

## Creating a Collection

1. Click **+ Collection**
2. Enter a collection name
3. Optionally add a description
4. Save the collection

Collections start empty - add items after creation.

## Adding Items to Collections

### From the Collection

1. Open the collection
2. Click **Add Items** or the **+** button
3. Browse available characters/scenarios
4. Select items to add
5. Confirm selection

### From Item Pages

When viewing a character or scenario:

1. Look for the **Collections** option
2. Select which collection(s) to add it to
3. The item is now in those collections

### Drag and Drop

Some views support dragging items directly into collections.

## Managing Collections

### Rename Collection

1. Open the collection
2. Click the edit/rename option
3. Enter the new name
4. Save

### Delete Collection

1. Select the collection
2. Click delete
3. Confirm deletion

Note: Deleting a collection does NOT delete the items in it - they remain in your library.

### Remove Items

1. Open the collection
2. Select items to remove
3. Click remove/delete from collection
4. Items are removed from the collection but not deleted

## Collection Types

### Character Collections

- **Theme** - Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Modern
- **Relationship** - Friends, Romantic, Professional

## Use Cases

### Content Curation

Create themed collections for different moods:

- "Adventure Time" - Action-oriented scenarios
- "Late Night" - NSFW content (if enabled)

### Testing and Development

- "Work in Progress" - Characters being developed
- "Testing" - New imports to evaluate
- "Broken" - Characters needing fixes

### Sharing

Collections can be exported as packages to share with others:
1. Create a collection with content to share
2. Export as a .voxpkg file
3. Share the file
4. Others import via the Import page

## Smart Organization Tips

### Consistent Naming

Use prefixes for quick sorting:
- `[Fantasy] Dragon's Lair`
- `[Modern] Coffee Shop Romance`
- `[WIP] New Character Test`

### Nested Organization

While collections are flat, you can simulate hierarchy:
- "Series - Episode 1"
- "Series - Episode 2"
- "Series - Characters"

### Regular Cleanup

Periodically review collections:
- Remove unused items
- Archive old collections
- Consolidate similar collections

## Collections vs Tags

Both help organize content:

| Collections | Tags |
|-------------|------|
| Manual grouping | Automatic categorization |
| Exclusive groups | Multiple tags per item |
| Custom organization | Predefined categories |
| Export as packages | Filter existing content |

Use both for maximum flexibility.
